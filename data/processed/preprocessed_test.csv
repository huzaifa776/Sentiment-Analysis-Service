"I ordered this for myself, but unfortunately got my waist measurement wrong. It comes in a nice black box that is very giftable. The package also included a tool for adding holes to the belt, which I found very useful, since most of us are not cookie-cutter-sized.  The belt looks great with jeans but could also be used with a dress. I liked that the belt is not PU plastic but rather cow hide.  All in all, a nice, solid belt!",i ordered this for myself but unfortunately got my waist measurement wrong it comes in a nice black box that is very giftable the package also included a tool for adding holes to the belt which i found very useful since most of us are not cookiecuttersized  the belt looks great with jeans but could also be used with a dress i liked that the belt is not pu plastic but rather cow hide  all in all a nice solid belt,1

"These Gerber Baby Girls' Footed Pajamas are a good buy if you need extra jammies, but they come with a few quirks. They're comfortable and easy to zip, and the material isn't too warm, which works well for keeping my little one cozy but not overheated.However, the fit is a bit off—the legs are quite long, while the butt area is tight, especially if your baby wears cloth diapers. They run a little big overall, which gives room to grow, but the snug fit around the bottom might make it a challenge for some. Still, they're a nice option for a few extra pajamas in the rotation.",these gerber baby girls footed pajamas are a good buy if you need extra jammies but they come with a few quirks theyre comfortable and easy to zip and the material isnt too warm which works well for keeping my little one cozy but not overheatedhowever the fit is a bit off—the legs are quite long while the butt area is tight especially if your baby wears cloth diapers they run a little big overall which gives room to grow but the snug fit around the bottom might make it a challenge for some still theyre a nice option for a few extra pajamas in the rotation,1

"I purchased this same shirt in four colors: black, white, gray, and purple. They are light weight but fit very well and are very soft and comfortable. They are longer shirts than tee shirts.

"These disposables are conveniently packed so they don't take up much space. The cotton/polyester blend socks looked tiny but they stretch to fit on a size 9, (though not my size 14 kid.) They're thin like dress socks but the stretchiness is supportive enough to feel comfortable while keeping them from sliding down. The underwear seemed a bit large compared to regular briefs of the same size. They looked somewhat less like women's underwear than similar products we've seen. They've even been able to be washed, dried in the dryer, and reworn a few times. These got used quickly because of a snowstorm keeping some family in town without clean clothes, so I'm glad I'd ordered these just enough ahead of time. I can definitely recommend keeping some of these in the glove box or trunk for emergencies.",these disposables are conveniently packed so they dont take up much space the cottonpolyester blend socks looked tiny but they stretch to fit on a size  though not my size  kid theyre thin like dress socks but the stretchiness is supportive enough to feel comfortable while keeping them from sliding down the underwear seemed a bit large compared to regular briefs of the same size they looked somewhat less like womens underwear than similar products weve seen theyve even been able to be washed dried in the dryer and reworn a few times these got used quickly because of a snowstorm keeping some family in town without clean clothes so im glad id ordered these just enough ahead of time i can definitely recommend keeping some of these in the glove box or trunk for emergencies,1

"This dress is great dressed down with open toed sandals or dressed up with fancy heels or boots. You can layer a cropped sweater over it in the winter and look chic, and wear it during the summer, as well. I love that this can carry me through all seasons! I say it runs TTS, I generally wear a size small and it fits great at 5 ft. Also, at 5ft it's long but does not touch the floor, I have a few inches to spare, which is perfect for me. The quality of the material is perfect, has held up well through many, many laundry cycles. I also have dried this dress and haven't experienced any shrinkage (if it has shrunk it's very minimal). I love the tie at the neckline you can tie in a bow or leave the strings hanging down. Very versatile piece, wouuld recommend to a friend or colleague for sure.",this dress is great dressed down with open toed sandals or dressed up with fancy heels or boots you can layer a cropped sweater over it in the winter and look chic and wear it during the summer as well i love that this can carry me through all seasons i say it runs tts i generally wear a size small and it fits great at  ft also at ft its long but does not touch the floor i have a few inches to spare which is perfect for me the quality of the material is perfect has held up well through many many laundry cycles i also have dried this dress and havent experienced any shrinkage if it has shrunk its very minimal i love the tie at the neckline you can tie in a bow or leave the strings hanging down very versatile piece wouuld recommend to a friend or colleague for sure,1

"These shirts are pretty nice. They seem pretty well made with no obvious issues. The coloring is consistent and the fabric is comfortable and looks good. The sizing is pretty true - maybe slightly small for the size. I wear 2x in most brands but ordered 3x just to be on the safe side. These fit pretty well, not quite like I would expect a 2x to fit but not as roomy as typical 3x either.Color selection is pretty neutral. Nothing too bright or flashy, which is just the way I like my polos.All in all, I think this is a great pack to get a a few extra shirts in the closet with a little variety in safe colors.",these shirts are pretty nice they seem pretty well made with no obvious issues the coloring is consistent and the fabric is comfortable and looks good the sizing is pretty true  maybe slightly small for the size i wear x in most brands but ordered x just to be on the safe side these fit pretty well not quite like i would expect a x to fit but not as roomy as typical x eithercolor selection is pretty neutral nothing too bright or flashy which is just the way i like my polosall in all i think this is a great pack to get a a few extra shirts in the closet with a little variety in safe colors,1

I got this dress for a wedding and it’s so flattering on. It fit true to size which was nice and it had a ton of stretch.

"I wish I took a picture of how these t-shirts came.  They were out of the inner packaging, there was supposed to be five shirts and only three were in there.  One was dirty like someone had taken two out of the packaging before it was shipped.  Very disappointed because Hanes is a good brand.  I do a lot of shopping through Amazon, so this was very upsetting to me.",i wish i took a picture of how these tshirts came  they were out of the inner packaging there was supposed to be five shirts and only three were in there  one was dirty like someone had taken two out of the packaging before it was shipped  very disappointed because hanes is a good brand  i do a lot of shopping through amazon so this was very upsetting to me,0
"After giving birth, I needed to get rid of pretty much all of my shoes because my feet got longer by a half size.I went to a sport shoe store and got a white pair of these and LOVED them. They are so comfy, provide me the right amount of arch and foot support. I come from a family where the women have larger than average foot size, so finding shoes can be difficult for me. Brooks offers a really nice size range, so it’s not too hard for me to find shoes that fit and are actually cute.For what I needed, these seem like they will be very durable, which is just daily walking and running around after a toddler.I got the purple color from Amazon when they had a little bit of a sale. I’m not typically a “need the same shoe in different colors” kind of person, but these shoes are just that good, in my opinion.",after giving birth i needed to get rid of pretty much all of my shoes because my feet got longer by a half sizei went to a sport shoe store and got a white pair of these and loved them they are so comfy provide me the right amount of arch and foot support i come from a family where the women have larger than average foot size so finding shoes can be difficult for me brooks offers a really nice size range so it’s not too hard for me to find shoes that fit and are actually cutefor what i needed these seem like they will be very durable which is just daily walking and running around after a toddleri got the purple color from amazon when they had a little bit of a sale i’m not typically a “need the same shoe in different colors” kind of person but these shoes are just that good in my opinion,1

"I absolutely love this shirt! I have it in two colors (green and navy) and wear them all the time. I especially like the green. The shirts are well worth the price. They fit nicely, are comfortable, and work well dressed down with jeans and tennis shoes or dressed up with nicer pants and flats. I kind of think of it as a nicer t-shirt since it has the flare on the sleeve. The fabric has a nice weight and thickness (not see through). It fits loosely, but not baggie. Even after numerous washes the fabric held its color well and didn't shrink (I wash shirts on cold and hang to dry). Great purchase if looking for a cute, inexpensive shirt.",i absolutely love this shirt i have it in two colors green and navy and wear them all the time i especially like the green the shirts are well worth the price they fit nicely are comfortable and work well dressed down with jeans and tennis shoes or dressed up with nicer pants and flats i kind of think of it as a nicer tshirt since it has the flare on the sleeve the fabric has a nice weight and thickness not see through it fits loosely but not baggie even after numerous washes the fabric held its color well and didnt shrink i wash shirts on cold and hang to dry great purchase if looking for a cute inexpensive shirt,1

Love these Jeans but be careful to read the the composition! This pair fit perfectly as had a good % of Elastine for good flex in the thigh and waste. I also purchased a pair in  Black same time but only 1% Elastine and was also smaller in these areas so way too tight. For the most comfortable flex fit want either 97% Cotton 3% Elastine or Have a lesser Cotton mix with at least 12% polyester then a 2% Elastine seem to pretty close as well.,love these jeans but be careful to read the the composition this pair fit perfectly as had a good  of elastine for good flex in the thigh and waste i also purchased a pair in  black same time but only  elastine and was also smaller in these areas so way too tight for the most comfortable flex fit want either  cotton  elastine or have a lesser cotton mix with at least  polyester then a  elastine seem to pretty close as well,1

"So I'm 5'8 158lbs and I ordered Medium. They are a little looser in size and length than I anticipated but I got used to that very quickly. I wear them for my 5am jog to the gym and they keep my legs nice and warm although they aren't thick like sweatpants. Great value for the money because they are well made, have nice zipper pockets for your phone and a great thick waistband. I would recommend and if you are someone who is looking for a slimmer fit you can probably get away with a size smaller because I know I could wear a small if I wanted vs medium.",so im  lbs and i ordered medium they are a little looser in size and length than i anticipated but i got used to that very quickly i wear them for my am jog to the gym and they keep my legs nice and warm although they arent thick like sweatpants great value for the money because they are well made have nice zipper pockets for your phone and a great thick waistband i would recommend and if you are someone who is looking for a slimmer fit you can probably get away with a size smaller because i know i could wear a small if i wanted vs medium,1
"I live in Montana and bought this for late fall thru early spring working outside. I have also used this for hiking during those times. I put this jacket through -20F to 45F in rain, snow, wet snowy rain, wind and sunshine. Bottom line is I liked it more than I didn't and for $40 I'm happy. BTW I bought the Army green version.If you are thinking about buying this, I feel like this is important to know:1 - It's a softshell outer jacket - Not a winter coat.  It is parka style meaning it comes down below the buttox and has 2 zippers on the front.2 - It's not waterproof - It is water repellant and did a good job in wet snow keeping me dry on a daily basis. It dried out fairly quicky when hung by a fire.3 - It's a really weird coat!PROS:Looks awesome!Lots of zippered pockets (which is also a con)Sleeve length was perfect and the bottom didn't rise up above my waist when reaching overhead.Loved the construction of the hood with the reinforced bill and the adjustable straps for both the hood and bottom of the jacket.The armpit zippers is why I bought this in the first place!Very thin layer of fleece on the inside.Snowshoeing at -10F with a base layer and the arm pit zippers open, I was plenty warm! Which is what I was looking for in jacket.CONS:The fit was off for me. Not by a lot, just a really small portion that didn't warrant ordering a larger size because then it would be way to big. It was tight in the shoulders and arms were super tight.No way you are getting cell phone in any of those arm pockets.Zippers are not seam sealedNo stretch to the materialVelcro cuff tighteners - yeah.....I don't see that lasting in the rain for more than a couple years.Not for hunting - this is the noisiest jacket I own! It is loud when you move!If you wear a short sleeved shirt under the jacket you can feel the cold armpit zippers on your inner arm.WEIRD:The elbows or perhaps forearms have a reinforced outer layer. But it doesn't come to the elbows on me or completely cover my forearms (for when I am crawling I guess?)It has these 2 inner pockets? Or for some other purpose that I can't figure out because it is not sewn on the bottom (see pic) So it stores nothing.You have these random weird velcro patches on the bottom of the jacket and back of the hood that I have no idea what they are for.I am guessing the weird velcro pocket on the inside of the hood is for you to roll up the hood, but why would you?Zippered back pockets - I can't even reach them! Not even sure what the purpose of them being there is other than to transport gear which I wouldn't do because the coat is not fully waterproof. Might be good for storing some cans of beer though on a hike.Inner cinching strings for the hood run along the inner coat into the kangaroo pockets. Easy to get this caught or torn (see pics)The jacket is weird, but it has worked well so all is good.",i live in montana and bought this for late fall thru early spring working outside i have also used this for hiking during those times i put this jacket through f to f in rain snow wet snowy rain wind and sunshine bottom line is i liked it more than i didnt and for  im happy btw i bought the army green versionif you are thinking about buying this i feel like this is important to know  its a softshell outer jacket  not a winter coat  it is parka style meaning it comes down below the buttox and has  zippers on the front  its not waterproof  it is water repellant and did a good job in wet snow keeping me dry on a daily basis it dried out fairly quicky when hung by a fire  its a really weird coatproslooks awesomelots of zippered pockets which is also a consleeve length was perfect and the bottom didnt rise up above my waist when reaching overheadloved the construction of the hood with the reinforced bill and the adjustable straps for both the hood and bottom of the jacketthe armpit zippers is why i bought this in the first placevery thin layer of fleece on the insidesnowshoeing at f with a base layer and the arm pit zippers open i was plenty warm which is what i was looking for in jacketconsthe fit was off for me not by a lot just a really small portion that didnt warrant ordering a larger size because then it would be way to big it was tight in the shoulders and arms were super tightno way you are getting cell phone in any of those arm pocketszippers are not seam sealedno stretch to the materialvelcro cuff tighteners  yeahi dont see that lasting in the rain for more than a couple yearsnot for hunting  this is the noisiest jacket i own it is loud when you moveif you wear a short sleeved shirt under the jacket you can feel the cold armpit zippers on your inner armweirdthe elbows or perhaps forearms have a reinforced outer layer but it doesnt come to the elbows on me or completely cover my forearms for when i am crawling i guessit has these  inner pockets or for some other purpose that i cant figure out because it is not sewn on the bottom see pic so it stores nothingyou have these random weird velcro patches on the bottom of the jacket and back of the hood that i have no idea what they are fori am guessing the weird velcro pocket on the inside of the hood is for you to roll up the hood but why would youzippered back pockets  i cant even reach them not even sure what the purpose of them being there is other than to transport gear which i wouldnt do because the coat is not fully waterproof might be good for storing some cans of beer though on a hikeinner cinching strings for the hood run along the inner coat into the kangaroo pockets easy to get this caught or torn see picsthe jacket is weird but it has worked well so all is good,1

"I recently purchased the G Gradual Men‚Äôs Sweatpants with Zipper Pockets, and they have quickly become my go-to pair for workouts and casual wear. The first thing I noticed is how comfortable they are‚Äîthe fabric is soft, lightweight, and breathable, making them ideal for any activity, whether I‚Äôm at the gym, running errands, or just lounging at home.One of the standout features is the zipper pockets. They are deep enough to securely hold my phone, keys, and wallet without worrying about anything falling out during workouts or outdoor activities. This is a game-changer, especially if you‚Äôre active and don‚Äôt want to carry a bag. The zippers are sturdy and smooth, which adds to the overall quality feel of these pants.The fit is perfect‚Äîslim but not too tight, with enough stretch for full range of motion. The elastic waistband with a drawstring ensures a snug fit, and they don‚Äôt lose their shape even after multiple washes. The sweatpants look great too, with a sleek, modern design that works well for both casual and athletic looks.In summary, the G Gradual Men‚Äôs Sweatpants are a fantastic combination of comfort, practicality, and style. The zipper pockets are a huge plus, and the quality of the material and fit is excellent.

"Well i bought this so i can have an affordable puffer jacket i can abuse and not feel bad about. used it for everything and anything that involved being cold outside.Not wanting to risk expensive jacket incase i ruin it or hate it i purchased this one but so far it has withstood the abuse. i am pleased with the purchase and i recommend it if your in the market for this item  and price is an issue . i have used it for  concerts ,camping ,late night shopping trips ,taking out the trash at 4 am also just for the random day hikes .things i like it packs really small and is very light it also comes with its own drawstring bag that seams to match the color you purchased , i think anyhow because i have purchased 4 different colors (Christmas presents for family members ) and all come this way.Also this thing does very well in windy conditions it seams to have a very thin feel for a puffer jacket but the small amount of insulations paired with the inner and outer shell of jacket material reminds me of safety blankets ability to reflect body heat back to you this feature for staying warm is doing great for lack of poof.i took this to a  outdoor concert in LA (besame mucho) and it was very cold and windy because of concert rules only small see through bags were allowed so i brought this jacket in its drawstring bag and took a very small amount of space and was perfect for the situation kept me warm through the whole night night. had very large outside pockets with zipper closures and very deep inside pocket behind the outside zip up ones, they seam to share the space keep this in mind when placing bulky items one side will use space from the other even thought they are separate a pocket . the hoody does not have draw strings but i dont feel needs them i think we have gotten use to everything needing drawstrings, it is a bit spacious inside the hood i guess if you have a beanie or a baseball style cap it should fit fine and extends just before the bill of cap. i just hated that they tried to ship it in no box just a clear see through bag the first time had to return arrived damaged.In new condition its durability is uncertain until this point it has held up (2months), not sure yet the feel is not the toughest it has a thin feel but notably i have not torn it and it has at least been through the wash once keep in mind i airdried all this said it looks brand new and is in great shape , i would whole heartedly recommend this jacket just look for the deals also get the vest for an added layer of warmth",well i bought this so i can have an affordable

"I was done with messing with cheap jackets. Frogg Toggs are great.. but too light weight when I'm not backpacking, or I'm out with my rocket club flying high power rockets. I needed a heavier duty, every day jacket/windbreaker. Something with a quality hood and good solid pockets. I almost bought a Swiss Tech from the store, but then saw this one.. and thought I would risk it. SO glad I did.. I love the look, the feel, even the smell.  The pockets are all water proof/resistant.. the zippers are good quality, the hood with big, snappable face flaps is great! The hood even has a heavy duty zipper to make it modular... and the cinchable waist and wrist pulls means you can really stay cozy on windy days.  Everything about this jacket is heavy duty.. I mean, not as heavy as my 5lb wax-canvas coat, but really heavy duty for a wind breaker!  I love it.. this is my new every day jacket.. and it really looks and feels great! I got one for my son too. :)UPDATE: The only con is I wish it had armpit gussets and more air flow slits.

"I had a preferred brand on Amazon for men’s shirts that fit taller men while being athletic fit. However, they have been out of stock for months so I took a chance and bought these.The fit is great, and it looks great. Loose in the abdomen tight in chest and sleeves just as advertised. The material quality is definitely superior to shirts I previously purchased. The neck area fits better than most, the stitching is much better quality. The material isn’t so thin that it feels cheap, but not so thick that it makes you hot.The ONLY COMPLAINT is they are not the length I was hoping for. The photos made it seem like they would be. When I lift my arms over my head the shirt shows my stomach. It’s just my pet peave. I’m 6’2” and have broad shoulders, and I hate that MOST shirts never seem to be long enough. If you are a tall guy this MAY be an issue. I’m afraid that they will all become unwearable after I wash them once but I’m going to give them a shot. Cross my fingers.That being said, for the majority of men out there, these shirts are a great choice. 5 star other than the length.

Arrived in a zippered plastic  bag without a foul odor or serious wrinkles.  Colors and pattern matches online picture and sizing was accurate.  Fabric/material is on the thinner side but it's soft and doesn't wrinkle easily.  The top has a loose fit that doesn cling but isn't baggy or sloppy looking.  The top doesn't hold in your body heat.  I washed in the washer on a regular cycle in cold water and dryed on medium heat in the dryer until almost dry then hung it to finish drying. No shrinking or wrinkling occured. I get compliments each time I wear it whether I dress it up or wear it with jeans and a cardigan. This top is so versatile it should be a staple in your wardrobe too!!

"Wearing a light colored shirt out to dinner while on vacation is a bit risky. Is there a good chance I manage to not get wine or food or dessert on it? Yes. Is there a good chance I get one or possibly all three on it? Also yes. So it's important to look good without being too pricey and ideally with the ability to withstand how I am. This shirt hits all of those points.Now, this is not a fully linen shirt, it's a linen blend that has the appearance of linen. For me, this is perfect because it means most things will wash out if they don't set, it's got a little bit of flex to it, and it doesn't wrinkle quite as easily or severely as linen. The fit is an athletic cut, which is what I was looking for. I'm 5' 10 192 lbs, medium frame, but bigger in the shoulders, 33 waist and the Medium was perfect. If you're a larger frame, go larger because the arms were a bit tight.I have it in white and blue. They were purchased for vacation/beach wear, but I think they may join the spring/supper rotation next year. Definitely a great value for what you get. I've purchased other items in the past from this brand and I've yet to be disappointed.

"I was never really a polo shirt person and, after having the four jobs in a row over the last 16 years where the uniform or dress code basically required a polo shirt or a dress shirt ... I started to understand why polo shirts can be such a tricky thing.  The tricky thing for me is to find the balance between something having thick enough fabric to have its own defined shape so that it fits and looks right ... while not being so thick that it either impedes movements or smothers me.  Further, with a previous brand I initially liked, I discovered the perils of cotton-based materials and that manufacturers may use a vastly different material mixture for different colors ... where, over time, some colors might remain XL because they're only 70% cotton), some might shrink slightly to L, and others might be even smaller than a M because they're 100% cotton.  Just very frustrating when you start off with the exact same brand, product line, and size and then less than 1/3 continue to fit properly.  That's why, when I started looking around for replacements of those I consider unwearable, I was glad to come across this particular polo shirt by Under Armor.  The product quality is  obvious even before putting it on.  And, once it is on, you can tell that it's not just a case of the fabric being a good thickness but that key areas are structurally reinforced not only to make it stronger but to also establish that desired profile.  Being intended for sports, it's also very comfortable to move around in and the relaxed fit and XXL sizing  was the perfect fit.  Even before for me, there is an extremely wide variety of color options ... while all being made from the same material.  Thus, providing me the variety of color choices that I love while avoiding a repeat of that last headache of shirts all starting off the same size originally but then gradually changing completely.  The fact they're also wrinkle-free and can just be rolled up for easy travel is the icing on the cake.",i was never really a polo shirt person and after having the four jobs in a row over the last  years where the uniform or dress code basically required a polo shirt or a dress shirt  i started to understand why polo shirts can be such a tricky thing  the tricky thing for me is to find the balance between something having thick enough fabric to have its own defined shape so that it fits and looks right  while not being so thick that it either impedes movements or smothers me  further with a previous brand i initially liked i discovered the perils of cottonbased materials and that manufacturers may use a vastly different material mixture for different colors  where over time some colors might remain xl because theyre only  cotton some might shrink slightly to l and others might be even smaller than a m because theyre  cotton  just very frustrating when you start off with the exact same brand product line and size and then less than  continue to fit properly  thats why when i started looking around for replacements of those i consider unwearable i was glad to come across this particular polo shirt by under armor  the product quality is  obvious even before putting it on  and once it is on you can tell that its not just a case of the fabric being a good thickness but that key areas are structurally reinforced not only to make it stronger but to also establish that desired profile  being intended for sports its also very comfortable to move around in and the relaxed fit and xxl sizing  was the perfect fit  even before for me there is an extremely wide variety of color options  while all being made from the same material  thus providing me the variety of color choices that i love while avoiding a repeat of that last headache of shirts all starting off the same size originally but then gradually changing completely  the fact theyre also wrinklefree and can just be rolled up for easy travel is the icing on the cake,1

"The dress was cute, but ran a bit too small.  The fault is in my body, not the fabrication.  The color was spot on and material was fine, nothing special, but it did not look CHEAP.  You could really dress it up and make it into something special.  It was a quick fix to an engagement and it fit the bill--price wise--but not my body well enough to wear on that day. I will keep the dress and if I drop 5 pounds, it will be just fine.

"So I've worn these jeans several times. And I've worn them at times where I didn't necessarily feel like I was really feeling my best. Do you know what I'm talking about? I wore these jeans to work with a baggy black hoodie and didn't really do much with my hair and was sort of rushing from work to an after work situation and I was focused more on just trying to get what I needed to get done done and not really focused super too much on my appearance, and two people at separate times said, dang girl! You're looking healthy in those jeans! (I'm paraphrasing for the sake of my reviewer status, but I think you get the picture.)  They're very high waisted, and I actually think that if you needed belly support,  like either at the beginning of a pregnancy or just postpartum, these might be really nice.  This might be nice Thanksgiving jeans if you know what I mean. They're stretchy and they are very energizing on your legs, and you don't have to wear them too tight or too loose to feel like they're really doing some nice things for your silhouette. I also liked that they had deep pockets that I could actually shove phone-sized objects into, and so that was an exciting moment for me.  I also think these would be great cosplay or dance jeans because they'll move with you and they feel really nice on. I mean you could take a yoga class in these jeans. I hesitate to use the word jeans to describe them because although they're stitched and styled to look like a classic jean, the fabric is really more like a yoga stretch but with a cotton finish, not with a Satine finish. They have a nice cotton feel to them, which I also very much like (even though I'm guessing there's a combination of spandex and Lycra in there). I'm pretty sure that these jeans come in a variety of different shades and colors and I specifically got the black ones. And yes. You can rest assured. Although I cannot speak to the other colors, because I'm just going to guess that it varies from shade to shade, the black pair that I have were opaque. You don't have to worry about things showing through. They were not see-through.  Overall I'm very satisfied with these and I hope that they really last. I've washed them a couple of times and there's no pilling or disintegration of the fabric so that's also very cool. And also great for the money. So yeah. Even on the day when I didn't really feel like I was looking my best, these jeans really felt great on and got some positive feedback, so I'm going to say a solid thumbs up on these. I'm 5'7 and the length was really good on me. It didn't drag the ground but it also wasn't too short. I felt like it hit it a nice place on my shoe but I also think you could wear them with heels and they wouldn't feel too short. Overall a solid piece.",so ive worn these jeans several times and ive worn them at times where i didnt necessarily feel like i was really feeling my best do you know what im talking about i wore these jeans to work with a baggy black hoodie and didnt really do much with my hair and was sort of rushing from work to an after work situation and i was focused more on just trying to get what i needed to get done done and not really focused super too much on my appearance and two people at separate times said dang girl youre looking healthy in those jeans im paraphrasing for the sake of my reviewer status but i think you get the picture  theyre very high waisted and i actually think that if you needed belly support  like either at the beginning of a pregnancy or just postpartum these might be really nice  this might be nice thanksgiving jeans if you know what i mean theyre stretchy and they are very energizing on your legs and you dont have to wear them too tight or too loose to feel like theyre really doing some nice things for your silhouette i also liked that they had deep pockets that i could actually shove phonesized objects into and so that was an exciting moment for me  i also think these would be great cosplay or dance jeans because theyll move with you and they feel really nice on i mean you could take a yoga class in these jeans i hesitate to use the word jeans to describe them because although theyre stitched and styled to look like a classic jean the fabric is really more like a yoga stretch but with a cotton finish not with a satine finish they have a nice cotton feel to them which i also very much like even though im guessing theres a combination of spandex and lycra in there im pretty sure that these jeans come in a variety of different shades and colors and i specifically got the black ones and yes you can rest assured although i cannot speak to the other colors because im just going to guess that it varies from shade to shade the black pair that i have were opaque you dont have to worry about things showing through they were not seethrough  overall im very satisfied with these and i hope that they really last ive washed them a couple of times and theres no pilling or disintegration of the fabric so thats also very cool and also great for the money so yeah even on the day when i didnt really feel like i was looking my best these jeans really felt great on and got some positive feedback so im going to say a solid thumbs up on these im  and the length was really good on me it didnt drag the ground but it also wasnt too short i felt like it hit it a nice place on my shoe but i also think you could wear them with heels and they wouldnt feel too short overall a solid piece,1
"I like that it has a lining, although you still want something underneath. The material is a little heavier than the anticipated, I like it very much. Look it over very carefully.

Neither does it have a zipper as described. It can still be washing in soap and water.

"I recently tried the Lee Extreme Motion jeans, and they’ve completely changed my expectations for comfort and flexibility in denim. These jeans are a game-changer for anyone who values both style and functionality.Fit and Comfort:The Extreme Motion technology truly lives up to its name. The jeans offer an incredible amount of stretch, making them feel almost like wearing leggings while still looking like classic denim. The fit is snug but not restrictive, with a mid-rise waist that sits comfortably without sliding down. Whether I’m running errands, sitting at my desk, or even doing light activities, these jeans move with me effortlessly. The articulated knees and gusseted crotch add to the flexibility, making them perfect for all-day wear.Material and Durability:The fabric is a blend of cotton and stretchy materials that feel soft yet durable. They have a nice weight to them, so they don’t feel flimsy or cheap. After several washes, the color has held up well, and there’s been no noticeable fading or loss of shape. The stitching and hardware (like the button and zipper) are solid and well-made, which gives me confidence in their longevity.Style and Design:These jeans have a modern, streamlined look that works for both casual and slightly dressier occasions. I opted for the dark wash, which is versatile and pairs easily with almost anything—t-shirts, sweaters, or even a blazer. The five-pocket design is classic, and the back pockets are flattering without being overly embellished. They’re a great balance of practicality and style.Value for Money:For the level of comfort, flexibility, and quality, these jeans are absolutely worth the price. They’re a step above regular denim in terms of functionality, and I can see them becoming a staple in my wardrobe for years to come.Final Thoughts:If you’re looking for jeans that combine the comfort of athletic wear with the style of traditional denim, the Lee Extreme Motion jeans are a must-try. They’re perfect for anyone with an active lifestyle or just someone who wants to feel comfortable without sacrificing style.

"My son-in-law loved this coat! He needed something waterproof, warm, but not bulky. It was a Christmas gift and he tried it on just as soon as he opened it. I ordered a large and it fit perfectly. Very well made, flat seams, flat zipper, cuffs fit snug to keep out rain and wind. When he put up the hood and realized it has a bill on it to keep sleet out of the eyes, and then zipped the coat up all the way to cover neck and chin ... well, it was obvious this coat would protect him from any wet windy weather. (also ordered were waterproof gloves) Very nice looking jacket. One of the best purchases I've made for him. He'll get lots of wear out of it. Highly recommend.",my soninlaw loved this coat he needed something waterproof warm but not bulky it was a christmas gift and he tried it on just as soon as he opened it i ordered a large and it fit perfectly very well made flat seams flat zipper cuffs fit snug to keep out rain and wind when he put up the hood and realized it has a bill on it to keep sleet out of the eyes and then zipped the coat up all the way to cover neck and chin  well it was obvious this coat would protect him from any wet windy weather also ordered were waterproof gloves very nice looking jacket one of the best purchases ive made for him hell get lots of wear out of it highly recommend,1

"I recently purchased a pair of Adidas Essential Open Hem pants, and I have to say that I am thoroughly impressed with the quality of these pants. From the moment I put them on, I could tell that they were made with high-quality materials and designed with both style and comfort in mind.While the pants did feel a bit snug at first, as I wore them more, they quickly became more flexible and comfortable. The open hem design of the pants also provides a great fit, and the elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place throughout the day.What really sets these pants apart, however, is their overall quality. The materials used in the construction of these pants are top-notch, and the attention to detail is evident in every aspect of their design.One thing that I appreciate about these pants is their versatility. They're perfect for a wide range of activities, from working out to running errands, and they can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Plus, the classic Adidas branding adds a touch of style to any outfit.Overall, I would highly recommend the Adidas Essential Open Hem pants to anyone looking for a high-quality, versatile pair of pants that can be worn in a variety of situations. They're stylish, comfortable, and built to last, making them a great investment for anyone who values quality and style.",i recently purchased a pair of adidas essential open hem pants and i have to say that i am thoroughly impressed with the quality of these pants from the moment i put them on i could tell that they were made with highquality materials and designed with both style and comfort in mindwhile the pants did feel a bit snug at first as i wore them more they quickly became more flexible and comfortable the open hem design of the pants also provides a great fit and the elastic waistband ensures that they stay in place throughout the daywhat really sets these pants apart however is their overall quality the materials used in the construction of these pants are topnotch and the attention to detail is evident in every aspect of their designone thing that i appreciate about these pants is their versatility theyre perfect for a wide range of activities from working out to running errands and they can easily be dressed up or down depending on the occasion plus the classic adidas branding adds a touch of style to any outfitoverall i would highly recommend the adidas essential open hem pants to anyone looking for a highquality versatile pair of pants that can be worn in a variety of situations theyre stylish comfortable and built to last making them a great investment for anyone who values quality and style,1
"Used to wear 13MWZs exclusively when I owned a ranch. This is the first pair I have bought in the last 20 years or so. What I like is that there has been no change in the color, comfort, style, denim weight or fit and finish of these jeans. Quality of fabrication (Mexico) is good. What I don't like is the denim seems to be woven less tight than it used to be. Will the denim be as durable as in the past? 13MWZ jeans used to be super-tough and took any chore you could throw at them from livestock handling to fencing. We'll see if my perception about the weave is correct but for now 4-stars.  Update 08Mar24: I went online to check if the weave of this product has changed. I read that Wrangler updated the weave of the rigid cotton fabric to allow movement of the fabric strands during flexing and washing. Allegedly, the service life of the 20x and 13MWG may be extended by up to 2-years. As per other reviews, yes the old rigid fabric has been replaced . Whoa is me, I prefer the true rigid fabric. The jeans lasted long enough and did not sag and bag during wearing like the new version. I detest comfort jeans with flex or synthetic add-ins to get products soft and stretchy out of the box...this is for pussy cats. I will maintain 4-stars as the jeans function as advertised. Please Wrangler, build the 13MWZ as before. If it ain't broke...don't fix it. Oh, for you guys whining about color fade, always wash your jeans inside out. The color will hold longer. Wash cold, hang to dry.  05Apr24. These jeans are so good for motorcycle riding I bought a second pair. After several washings, no shrinkage, no unraveling and no fit/shape change. From 4-stars to 5-stars. 14Aug24. Bought a pair of Shadow Black jeans to wear to forgo the blues for more lofty social activities.

I watched a youtube video on how to tie a dress bow which turns out to be pretty simple. I did have to use a safety pin to keep it tied in place. Because the material is heavy, the bow comes untied easily with movement if not pinned down. I was very pleased with this purchase. I am 5’6 and 160 pounds. I ordered a large and it fit great.

"I like Carhartt t-shirts, as they are very well built. I always shop the sales as they tend to be pricey. I have learned that every shirt that is styled under the loose fit line, I have to size one size down. For example, I always wear an XL in any shirt. For Carhartt loose fit, I buy a large or I will be swimming in it. I many, so you can trust me on this. I have also bought them as gifts for many people, and I always buy one size down from their normal shirt size and they have all fit them perfectly with a little room left over.

I washed mine a couple of times and they are close to new each time.  They don't last as long as I hoped but they are very light and comfortable.  The only thing I don't like is the lack of a grip when the floor is wet.  You have to be very careful because it will get slippery very fast.  It has practically no grip on any surface once it's wet.  That's very dangerous and prob the only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars.,i washed mine a couple of times and they are close to new each time  they dont last as long as i hoped but they are very light and comfortable  the only thing i dont like is the lack of a grip when the floor is wet  you have to be very careful because it will get slippery very fast  it has practically no grip on any surface once its wet  thats very dangerous and prob the only reason why i wouldnt give it  stars,1

"I regularly wear Skechers shoes in 9 wide or 9 1/2 regular.  Ordered 9 1/2 regular black because it was much cheaper than 9 W.

Not sure if I will keep for summer to wear with no socks banking on it stretching a bit to be more comfortable. The padding is comfortable for no socks. Because it is snug, I should return it and watch for 9W to come down in price. Note: my 9W previously bought elsewhere in this style is very roomy.

"I purchased this shoe as well as a pair of the Skecher Afterburn M tennis shoes.  I wanted a dedicated work shoe, because I was going though my shoes pretty quickly from wearing the same pair all the time.  So, being that I had already had two previous pairs of the “Afterburn” shoe, and burned through each of them in just over a year respectively, I decided to get another pair of them and also get a pair of the Cessnock Food Service Shoe strictly for work.  Both pairs of shoes arrived yesterday, and today I wore the Food Service shoe (FSS) to work for the first time.I slipped them on and found them to be a perfect fit.  They are very light weight and comfortable.  Usually, I find new shoes need a few days of wear to break-in until they really conform to the shape of your foot and then begin to fit well, but that wasn’t the case with these FSS shoes; they fit perfectly the moment I put them on.I wore them all day at work and discovered something that really surprised me.  We had a snowstorm today and got about 2” by the time I got to work, and had a good 7” by the end of my shift.  I park outside so of course I have to brush the snow off the car.  After doing so I knocked the snow off my shoes before getting into the car.  I was surprised to see that the snow didn’t stick to the material on top of the shoes, it was as if there was a water repellant in/on the material.  I was sort of wondering why my feet weren’t getting cold while I was cleaning off my car and I guess that explains it.  Another surprise was the fact that these shoes make no sound when walking on a tile floor while having wet soles.  The “Afterburn” tennis shoes squeak like a rusty hinge when the bottom of the shoe is wet and you walk across tile or other such surfaces, but the FSS’s, are quiet as a mouse, not a sound comes from them, you could almost call them Ninja shoes.As for the style, well that’s a personal preference and these shoes suit me just fine.  I think they look sharp, and nobody even noticed I had a new pair of shoes on today.Durability is the unanswered question and being that I’ve only worn them one day, that question will remain unanswered for a while.  If I can get a solid two years out of them, just wearing them to work, I will definitely buy them again and certainly would recommend them to a friend.I hope this review helps with your decision.

"This Sketchers Slip On style works well for me. Initially, I thought the heel section was a little loose felling when I walked but after using them for a few days I no longer felt that way.

"As a woman who wants to venture into raw denim, and having read the reviews that caution against sizing, I ordered a size bigger than I would have needed, thinking that it would work better for my hips. I used the shrink to fit method - soaking them in hot water for an hour, pressing before dripping dry, then putting them on while damp to shape them. I did not expect the waist to stretch back out so much within one wear. By the time they were dry, I found that they sat under my waist, so I washed and donated them and have ordered one in my size.I like that the material is sturdy and well made - the first day after wearing them, I changed out of them to find slight chafing on the front of my thighs. It didn't bother me too much, though. Due to the thickness of the material, they withstand the wind and keep my legs warm. Though it seems that some wish the colour were darker, I like that they are a unique blue because it makes them look like the simple work jeans they are meant to be.I already love the 14MWZ I have and look forward to experimenting with the shrink to fit process on the ones I have ordered in my size.",as a woman who wants to venture into raw denim and having read the reviews that caution against sizing i ordered a size bigger than i would have needed thinking that it would work better for my hips i used the shrink to fit method  soaking them in hot water for an hour pressing before dripping dry then putting them on while damp to shape them i did not expect the waist to stretch back out so much within one wear by the time they were dry i found that they sat under my waist so i washed and donated them and have ordered one in my sizei like that the material is sturdy and well made  the first day after wearing them i changed out of them to find slight chafing on the front of my thighs it didnt bother me too much though due to the thickness of the material they withstand the wind and keep my legs warm though it seems that some wish the colour were darker i like that they are a unique blue because it makes them look like the simple work jeans they are meant to bei already love the mwz i have and look forward to experimenting with the shrink to fit process on the ones i have ordered in my size,1

"Why is it so hard to find good boxer shorts these days?  Even when you search specifically for boxer shorts, more than half of the results brought up are for those sack-scrunching boxer briefs.  A LOT of searching finally yielded these, so I took a chance, and they are some of the most comfortable boxer shorts I've ever worn.They're soft against the skin and loose enough to allow for air circulation.  Great for everyday wear, or even wearing in bed, if that's how you sleep.  While I have worn some more comfortable boxers in my life, these are still near the top of the list, and you just can't beat them for the price.Highly recommended!",why is it so hard to find good boxer shorts these days  even when you search specifically for boxer shorts more than half of the results brought up are for those sackscrunching boxer briefs  a lot of searching finally yielded these so i took a chance and they are some of the most comfortable boxer shorts ive ever worntheyre soft against the skin and loose enough to allow for air circulation  great for everyday wear or even wearing in bed if thats how you sleep  while i have worn some more comfortable boxers in my life these are still near the top of the list and you just cant beat them for the pricehighly recommended,1

"Just an ok pant. Important things we noticed- length- they are too long- my husband is always a 30” in seam and in these he will need a 29” which they don’t offer- so we’ll have to either have them hemmed or returnWaist- these are the size stated when stretched- my husband is a 38” waist and these barely fit- no extra room- so size up if you’re wanting some flexibility.

"These are commonly referred to as a dupe of the much more expensive Lululemon shorts. I needed athletic shorts and ordered both at the same time with a 5-inch inseam and linerless to see how close they actually are. I like a good deal, but I am also quite picky about quality and longevity. I read many reviews before buying, and here is the review I wish I had read.So...Are these just as good as the expensive shorts for less than half the price?-Fit:The term dupe means the same exact cut as the original. So, are they a true dupe? They are close.I ordered the 5-inch inseam in the CRZ shorts, and it feels more like a 6-inch inseam, so I tend to roll the band, which makes them feel more like a 5-inch inseam. You can see this difference in the pictures I've provided. Overall, they fit true to size. I ordered a L in both brands, and they fit about the same, maybe with slightly more leg room in the CRZ shorts.-Feel:Many say they feel exactly like the LL shorts. I'm fairly picky and disagree.It's closer in fit than it is in feel. They are not as soft, though they still feel quite nice in their own way. This could be due to the LL shorts' material being brushed in production or the material composition. The LL pace breaker shorts use rayon, which is a more premium fabric than the spandex used in the CRZ shorts. CRZ's material is thinner than the LL pace breaker, which makes them feel flowy in comparison. I like how lightweight the CRZ shorts feel. It barely feels like you have anything on.-Finish:You mostly get what you pay for here, with a little caveat...The pockets on the CRZ shorts are much better at accommodating my larger iPhone 11 Pro Max. Very deep pockets. The zipper on the CRZ shorts does feel a bit thinner and not as high quality as the LL. The pace breaker zipper feels sturdier and glides open with ease. The zipper on the CRZ is not as smooth. Hardware like zippers, grommets, buttons, etc., are where some costs were cut.I was hesitant to order these with people complaining about the drawstring fraying from the metal end coming loose after washing. I followed the wash instructions using cold water and air drying. I did not have this problem. I'm inclined to believe it's user error, assuming the metal end was more likely to come loose with heat and friction. The LL shorts use a plastic branded drawstring end, and the CRZ shorts use metal. The metal feels more premium by far.The CRZ shorts have a silicone label at the hem, and the LL have a stiffer plastic label. Silicone labels tend to not hold up as well if they are heat pressed. The CRZ branding seems to hold up well after washes.The color of the CRZ shorts is fairly accurate to the images shown online. I ordered a pair of the Green Sage and Gull Grey.-Final Verdict:Will I be buying more CRZ shorts or more Lululemon? I will be buying more CRZ.With the CRZ shorts, you get a little more than you pay for, and with the Lululemon, I think you are paying more than what you actually get. Comparing these two isn't fair, and I think the CRZ are good in their own way. I will be buying more of whatever lasts longer ultimately and will update this review if anything changes.-TL;DR: Buy the CRZ because they are good in their own way and not because they are a dupe.",these are commonly referred to as a dupe of the much more expensive lululemon shorts i needed athletic shorts and ordered both at the same time with a inch inseam and linerless to see how close they actually are i like a good deal but i am also quite picky about quality and longevity i read many reviews before buying and here is the review i wish i had readsoare these just as good as the expensive shorts for less than half the pricefitthe term dupe means the same exact cut as the original so are they a true dupe they are closei ordered the inch inseam in the crz shorts and it feels more like a inch inseam so i tend to roll the band which makes them feel more like a inch inseam you can see this difference in the pictures ive provided overall they fit true to size i ordered a l in both brands and they fit about the same maybe with slightly more leg room in the crz shortsfeelmany say they feel exactly like the ll shorts im fairly picky and disagreeits closer in fit than it is in feel they are not as soft though they still feel quite nice in their own way this could be due to the ll shorts material being brushed in production or the material composition the ll pace breaker shorts use rayon which is a more premium fabric than the spandex used in the crz shorts crzs material is thinner than the ll pace breaker which makes them feel flowy in comparison i like how lightweight the crz shorts feel it barely feels like you have anything onfinishyou mostly get what you pay for here with a little caveatthe pockets on the crz shorts are much better at accommodating my larger iphone  pro max very deep pockets the zipper on the crz shorts does feel a bit thinner and not as high quality as the ll the pace breaker zipper feels sturdier and glides open with ease the zipper on the crz is not as smooth hardware like zippers grommets buttons etc are where some costs were cuti was hesitant to order these with people complaining about the drawstring fraying from the metal end coming loose after washing i followed the wash instructions using cold water and air drying i did not have this problem im inclined to believe its user error assuming the metal end was more likely to come loose with heat and friction the ll shorts use a plastic branded drawstring end and the crz shorts use metal the metal feels more premium by farthe crz shorts have a silicone label at the hem and the ll have a stiffer plastic label silicone labels tend to not hold up as well if they are heat pressed the crz branding seems to hold up well after washesthe color of the crz shorts is fairly accurate to the images shown online i ordered a pair of the green sage and gull greyfinal verdictwill i be buying more crz shorts or more lululemon i will be buying more crzwith the crz shorts you get a little more than you pay for and with the lululemon i think you are paying more than what you actually get comparing these two isnt fair and i think the crz are good in their own way i will be buying more of whatever lasts longer ultimately and will update this review if anything changestldr buy the crz because they are good in their own way and not because they are a dupe,1
I have several dresses by this brand Pretty Garden and I love all of them.  They wash well in cold water and hang to dry.  I wear the XXL and they seem flattering to larger sizes too the way they are cut.  The only time I have returned one was because the colors of the pattern looked very different in person than in the photos and I didn't care for it so I bought a different pattern in the same dress.  But other than that all my dress purchases by this brand have been good and I reccomend them highly.  They are pretty and comfortable with good materials.  The dress will be wrinkled/creased when you take it out of the package so plan to iron or wash and hang to dry before your event.  But once you do that you won't have any problems with it wrinkling when you wear it.,i have several dresses by this brand pretty garden and i love all of them  they wash well in cold water and hang to dry  i wear the xxl and they seem flattering to larger sizes too the way they are cut  the only time i have returned one was because the colors of the pattern looked very different in person than in the photos and i didnt care for it so i bought a different pattern in the same dress  but other than that all my dress purchases by this brand have been good and i reccomend them highly  they are pretty and comfortable with good materials  the dress will be wrinkledcreased when you take it out of the package so plan to iron or wash and hang to dry before your event  but once you do that you wont have any problems with it wrinkling when you wear it,1

"They look a bit clunky but they definitely did the job of supporting my ankle and did not really feel any heavier than previous Brooks I had used before (my latest pair of running shoes were New Balance and the Brooks Ghost Max was definitely no heavier than those). I had hurt my ankle and have plantar fasciitis, which had prevented me from running for a couple of months and so I was somewhat apprehensive about restarting.  This was the main reason for choosing the Brooks Ghost Max as they had great reviews for ankle control and cushioning.  The experience was a success, and while I may still need to give my ankle a few days to recover between successive runs, the shoes did a fantastic job at keeping it straight and comfortable.",they look a bit clunky but they definitely did the job of supporting my ankle and did not really feel any heavier than previous brooks i had used before my latest pair of running shoes were new balance and the brooks ghost max was definitely no heavier than those i had hurt my ankle and have plantar fasciitis which had prevented me from running for a couple of months and so i was somewhat apprehensive about restarting  this was the main reason for choosing the brooks ghost max as they had great reviews for ankle control and cushioning  the experience was a success and while i may still need to give my ankle a few days to recover between successive runs the shoes did a fantastic job at keeping it straight and comfortable,1

"I bought this coat to keep me warm while snow-blowing. I needed something warm but didn't want to spend much money since I wouldn't use it that often. However, I really like this coat and will wear it for more than just clearing snow. I wore it out the other morning in 10-degree F weather, which was pretty warm. The neck felt slightly cold, but I also removed the hood. I ordered a large one, and it fits well. I'm 5 9 and 180 pounds.**Pros:**- Well built-  Pretty Stylish- The fur on the inside and soft and comfortable- It has zippered pockets on the side and one on the front chest- Velcro closures for around the wrists and neck area- Velcro sections along the front zipper to help hold it closed.- Surprisingly warm for its weight.- Removable hood with zipper for attachment.**Cons:**- I wish the inside of the arms had the same fur as the rest of the coat.- The front zipper feels a little small to me. So far, so good, but this is a potential failure point.I would buy this coat again. I'm more happy with it than I thought I'd be.

"I’m just starting my running journey, and these shoes have been a fantastic choice! The shoes offer a great balance of support and that barefoot feel, making them super comfortable for both running and everyday wear. They have great grip and feel stable, plus the non-slip sole gives me confidence on different surfaces.They do run a little big! I probably could have gone a half size down for a snugger fit, but they still work well with thicker socks. And can we talk about the color? Absolutely adorable!

"These are cute, the fabric does stretch sightly once wet and the white got ruined after the first couple of days I wore these....the reason I'm giving them 5 stars is these are the most ANTI SLIP flip flops I've ever had. We were getting married on a cruise, which is the only reason I chose white, the deck of the ship was soaking all the time and I was so worried I'd slip and fall while drinking but I didn't. Eventually, I tested them and tried to slide, and they stuck right to the deck. Many of the flip flops I've had have had the slippery when wet issue, these were very good in that area. I actually just bought a second pair this time in black on black. I'm not sure how long the fabric will stay connected to the shoe since I only wore these a few days, but I'm going to keep these for when we go to pools and fishing on rocks for the sole purpose of feeling confident I won't slip and fall. These are comfortable, they do not sink in for support BUT they are also not thin either, so someplace in the middle on support. For $13 they are well worth the price.",these are cute the fabric does stretch sightly once wet and the white got ruined after the first couple of days i wore thesethe reason im giving them  stars is these are the most anti slip flip flops ive ever had we were getting married on a cruise which is the only reason i chose white the deck of the ship was soaking all the time and i was so worried id slip and fall while drinking but i didnt eventually i tested them and tried to slide and they stuck right to the deck many of the flip flops ive had have had the slippery when wet issue these were very good in that area i actually just bought a second pair this time in black on black im not sure how long the fabric will stay connected to the shoe since i only wore these a few days but im going to keep these for when we go to pools and fishing on rocks for the sole purpose of feeling confident i wont slip and fall these are comfortable they do not sink in for support but they are also not thin either so someplace in the middle on support for  they are well worth the price,1

The shirt looks great and is comfortable enough to wear all day. The ribbed texture adds a nice touch and enhances the overall feel.Material and Quality: The material is fantastic – soft against the skin and ribbed throughout. It feels high-quality, and the design, sleeve length, and neck opening are all well-executed. The quality of this shirt is spot-on and on par with, or even exceeding, its value.Style and Versatility: This polo is incredibly versatile. It can be dressed up or down, making it suitable for various occasions. I can easily wear it with jeans, khakis, or even slacks and a jacket. It's appropriate for work, casual outings, and most other events.Color: I purchased the denim blue color, and it looks even better in person than it does online. I rarely say that about garments unless I've seen them in person first.Overall Impression: This COOFANDY polo shirt is a fantastic find. The combination of comfort, quality, style, and versatility makes it a great value. I'm very pleased with my purchase and hope it lasts a long time.Recommendation: I highly recommend this shirt.

This would be my favorite jacket if the cuffs were not so tight/ if Carhartt used the same larger zipper from the older jackets (small zipper will be a pain to zip in the cold for sure, as other reviewers have rightly mentioned)/ Also the hand pockets are small... so I changed my rating from 3 stars to 4. If Carhartt fixed these 3 issues, then this would easily be my favorite jacket!-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I'm 6'3 and 230 lbs.,was in great shape back in the day (Lifted weights/ Army lean an' mean), but now I look like a weasel that's preggers... So anyways, this new Large/ Tall sized jacket fits tighter in the chest area than my old Carhartt Large/ Regular (old Carhartt was a cheaper hooded style/ basic model). The sleeves are tighter compared to the old style (maybe because of Sherpa lining?), but the BIG reason I am leaving this review and returning this product for an XL/ Tall is because the sleeve cuffs are SOOO tight!! Even the outer sleeve around the stretchy cuff is crazy tight, so no way to pull my sweatshirt sleeves through the jacket cuffs and absolutely no way for me to tuck my long wool gloves inside the cuffs.This particular jacket was made in Indonesia. I know that the same model of clothing made in different countries will vary slightly (goes for all brands), but I am not sure if it is a quality control issue or if this new upgraded jacket is sized differently compared to the old base Carhartt model.Another con is that the zipper is smaller, as others have mentioned.Pros: this jacket feels warmer than my old basic model, arm movement will be better (in larger size, lol). I LOVE the Sherpa lining! Also, despite having a smaller zipper, I absolutely love the snap-over buttons! It is absolutely worth paying more for the upgraded buttons and lining!I hate to leave less than stellar review, but I will update it after I exchange this jacket for a larger one... If it is a quick worry-free exchange, then I will up the stars. If not, well... ITS COLD AND I NEED A JACKET NOW!!",update i returned the ltall via ups drop off cost me  for them to box it up lesson learned i now have an xltall and thankfully have slightly more room for my wrists in the cuff area still very tight in the bottom part of sleeves but at least it will fit over my gloves this would be my favorite jacket if the cuffs were not so tight if carhartt used the same larger zipper from the older jackets small zipper will be a pain to zip in the cold for sure as other reviewers have rightly mentioned also the hand pockets are small so i changed my rating from  stars to  if carhartt fixed these  issues then this would easily be my favorite jacketim  and  lbswas in great shape back in the day lifted weights army lean an mean but now i look like a weasel thats preggers so anyways this new large tall sized jacket fits tighter in the chest area than my old carhartt large regular old carhartt was a cheaper hooded style basic model the sleeves are tighter compared to the old style maybe because of sherpa lining but the big reason i am leaving this review and returning this product for an xl tall is because the sleeve cuffs are sooo tight even the outer sleeve around the stretchy cuff is crazy tight so no way to pull my sweatshirt sleeves through the jacket cuffs and absolutely no way for me to tuck my long wool gloves inside the cuffsthis particular jacket was made in indonesia i know that the same model of clothing made in different countries will vary slightly goes for all brands but i am not sure if it is a quality control issue or if this new upgraded jacket is sized differently compared to the old base carhartt modelanother con is that the zipper is smaller as others have mentionedpros this jacket feels warmer than my old basic model arm movement will be better in larger size lol i love the sherpa lining also despite having a smaller zipper i absolutely love the snapover buttons it is absolutely worth paying more for the upgraded buttons and liningi hate to leave less than stellar review but i will update it after i exchange this jacket for a larger one if it is a quick worryfree exchange then i will up the stars if not well its cold and i need a jacket now,1

"This is my first amazon review ever, and I buy almost everything on amazon. I have tried so many other brands of shirts like this on amazon and these are by far the best quality, have the best colors, and have the most attractive and natural fit. I wear them every day. Very breathable. The brushed, mottled colors are the best in my opinion. Wash cold, as after 2 years of constant washing on hot they shrink maybe 8% and loose about 3% of the color. That seems bad but I thrash these as an outdoor enthusiast and they have never ripped or disappointed. I have my cousin now on them too. I will have these as my go-to for the rest of my life. I just bought more and I’m so happy. The price is unbeatable.  I happily bought them to my needs regardless if there was a Black Friday / prime day even steeper sale.They pair so well with these shorts (mottled colors and matching material) BALLENZ, although the shorts are slightly long for running if you are short, so I roll them once from the top if I am running for the perfect size. If I am rock climbing, I leave them down so the harness does not ride up. I may find a better pair of shorts that has zipper pockets, as occasionally in the car I’ll have my keys fall out, but these shirts are 100% worth my money. They rival and beat many Nikes and Under Armour that I’ve had. Enjoy.",this is my first amazon review ever and i buy almost everything on amazon i have tried so many other brands of shirts like this on amazon and these are by far the best quality have the best colors and have the most attractive and natural fit i wear them every day very breathable the brushed mottled colors are the best in my opinion wash cold as after  years of constant washing on hot they shrink maybe  and loose about  of the color that seems bad but i thrash these as an outdoor enthusiast and they have never ripped or disappointed i have my cousin now on them too i will have these as my goto for the rest of my life i just bought more and i’m so happy the price is unbeatable  i happily bought them to my needs regardless if there was a black friday  prime day even steeper salethey pair so well with these shorts mottled colors and matching material ballenz although the shorts are slightly long for running if you are short so i roll them once from the top if i am running for the perfect size if i am rock climbing i leave them down so the harness does not ride up i may find a better pair of shorts that has zipper pockets as occasionally in the car i’ll have my keys fall out but these shirts are  worth my money they rival and beat many nikes and under armour that i’ve had enjoy,1
"We bought a light blue large. My husband is 6'2 189lb. The jacket fits nicely with a t-shirt.  If you want a little more room in the arms with a long sleeve underneath, I'd suggest a size up.  It will keep the wind out, rain out, and has a really nice fleece lining to keep you warm. It's comfortable and easy to move in.  Doesn't feel bulky.

For reference I am a women 5’3 and 135 lbs and ordered a small. I have slim legs and these pants fit me like a straight cut. They aren’t overly baggy but might be tight for a guy with thicker thighs.These pants are very breathable. I bought them to wear in my warehouse job which gets very hot. The length is long but cuffing them doesn’t look bad. I had to cuff them twice.I saw people complaining about how long the crotch is but that’s because these are not low rise pants. If you want low rise pants that are below the waist these aren’t for you. The crotch will hang too low if you wear them below the waist. I love high rise pants and it’s all I wear because it keeps my shirt tucked in and puts no pressure on my lower stomach. These pants are meant to be worn at the belly button.I have not washed them yet so I can’t comment on how much they shrink but I will be handing washing these always because of the material. There is no zipper but it has a very long drawstring. Too long for me which I think I will cut.There is two side pockets and one large back pocket enough to fit a wallet.,for reference i am a women ’ and  lbs and ordered a small i have slim legs and these pants fit me like a straight cut they aren’t overly baggy but might be tight for a guy with thicker thighsthese pants are very breathable i bought them to wear in my warehouse job which gets very hot the length is long but cuffing them doesn’t look bad i had to cuff them twicei saw people complaining about how long the crotch is but that’s because these are not low rise pants if you want low rise pants that are below the waist these aren’t for you the crotch will hang too low if you wear them below the waist i love high rise pants and it’s all i wear because it keeps my shirt tucked in and puts no pressure on my lower stomach these pants are meant to be worn at the belly buttoni have not washed them yet so i can’t comment on how much they shrink but i will be handing washing these always because of the material there is no zipper but it has a very long drawstring too long for me which i think i will cutthere is two side pockets and one large back pocket enough to fit a wallet,1

Similarly, the sleeves are long enough to cover the entire upper-arm, as opposed to a lot of modern polos that stop mid-bicep.

"These are an adult man's shorts. They fit nice, stretch where needed and can be wash and wear or taken to cleaners for a more formal crease.

"For the price, I was surprised how well the coat is made. The seams are done well with tight stitching, and the internal fabric is smooth and comfortable.

The large was close, but the chest was just a little tight. I'm 5' 11 200 lbs, with low body fat. The large fit, but if I added a sweater underneath it was a little too tight.

They’re only a slightly lighter color than in the photo, but it’s barely noticeable. As a 5’9” 150-160 lb. man who typically wears a 30/32 pant size, the mediums are just a little bit baggier on me than they are on the photo model, especially in the crotch region.

"I'm picky about shirts, but this one passed the test. It's good quality material, good coloring. Hangs just right. Covers your front and backsides. Could wear with leggings or jeans.

"I've been through 4 pairs now. I have a treadmill desk and log all miles carefully, so I can say confidently I put on 400-450 miles of treadmill use on each pair, plus they are my daily driver so probably closer to 650 miles per year.I echo all the positive remarks about slip resistance, easy to put on, cushioned without feeling like I'm on a balloon, and subdued but professional appearance.On durability, I'm a little disappointed that they only last a year, but this was the first shoe I've tried on my treadmill desk, so I'm not sure how it compares to other shoes.In any case, every shoe has eventually failed in the same way, after a year of constant use: the plastic shaper in the heel falls apart and starts poking at my heel, and the cover of the foam insert disintegrates in a way that starts to wear my socks out quickly. It took me three pairs to realize that's why my expensive socks weren't lasting as long as they should.All said, I'll buy them again. They fit really well and look nice and are very comfortable to walk hundreds of miles in.

"I write the review upon receiving, but I already have something to say.I am 5-4 height and about 136 pounds. Slightly apple shaped. I am between S and M. Pants 6-10.I purchased black lined pants, medium size with the only inseam option 30/31.The material is very soft and stretchy. The quality is to test, so far so good. The amounts of pockets pleased me.In the title it is said -High Waisted-. I would not say that. I am not tall, but the best look is when the upper line is on my thinnest part of my waist. I would call it regular. The seller's picture shows it well (on the picture it is below the model's navel). Mine is approximately an my navel line. So my opinion is: the are definitely not low waist, but definitely not high waist.Tummy control. Also my word is Nay. It is just regular at me. May be Small would provide some tummy control but I am afraid Small would be inconvenient.My most concern was length. For my size they were way too long. I think even with high heel stiletto they would be long for me. My impression was 35 inseam (I did not measured them). I know that 29 inseam is short on me and 30 is just the size. So I folded the bottoms of legs and sewed them. So tall ladies will be glad, I think.",i write the review upon receiving but i already have something to sayi am  height and about  pounds slightly apple shaped i am between s and m pants i purchased black lined pants medium size with the only inseam option the material is very soft and stretchy the quality is to test so far so good the amounts of pockets pleased mein the title it is said high waisted i would not say that i am not tall but the best look is when the upper line is on my thinnest part of my waist i would call it regular the sellers picture shows it well on the picture it is below the models navel mine is approximately an my navel line so my opinion is the are definitely not low waist but definitely not high waisttummy control also my word is nay it is just regular at me may be small would provide some tummy control but i am afraid small would be inconvenientmy most concern was length for my size they were way too long i think even with high heel stiletto they would be long for me my impression was  inseam i did not measured them i know that  inseam is short on me and  is just the size so i folded the bottoms of legs and sewed them so tall ladies will be glad i think,1

"I bought these because my 9 month old is outgrowing EVERYTHING - he's so tall!

"Size fits perfectly. My typical pants range is 34 by 30, I decided to go with a 33 by 30 instead. So a size smaller than my typical size. Largely because I hated having to wear a belt all the time on the 34's of other jean brands. These pants have a fair amount of stretch, so even if you order one below your normal waist size they should fit fine. I'm 5'11 and 200 lbs, they're slightly long, but I prefer to have the pants be a little bit longer than too short because it blends them in nice with my shoes. No issues sitting down or getting up. No indication that they'd rip or anything. The size lower is tight, but a comfortable tight.I washed them out of the packet on cold and a 60 minute drying timer, of which they did not shrink, deform or lose color. They didn't appear to be returns or anything.They fit better than expected, tighter around the buttock area but that's what I get for ordering under my normal size. Pockets are nice, able to hold my S24 Ultra with a case on it (not a small phone) so it'll hold most anything from a phone to a wallet. The pants do have standard rear pockets that appear to be able to hold a standard wallet. Rear pockets are about wallet height, forward pockets can fit my entire hand up to my wrist just fine. They're not too wide though, probably just enough to fit a phone and wallet ontop of each other and that's it.They feel sturdy enough to withstand most types of work.The only thing I don't like about the pants is the zipper. It's too long, like twice as long as the normal zipper you'd find on a pair of Wranglers or something. Nothing that'll dissuade most buyers, but I find zipping them all the way up to be kind of a pain. Could be that I ordered a size lower for sure, so it might just be me.10/10 will definitely buy again.",size fits perfectly my typical pants range is  by  i decided to go with a  by  instead so a size smaller than my typical size largely because i hated having to wear a belt all the time on the s of other jean brands these pants have a fair amount of stretch so even if you order one below your normal waist size they should fit fine im  and  lbs theyre slightly long but i prefer to have the pants be a little bit longer than too short because it blends them in nice with my shoes no issues sitting down or getting up no indication that theyd rip or anything the size lower is tight but a comfortable tighti washed them out of the packet on cold and a  minute drying timer of which they did not shrink deform or lose color they didnt appear to be returns or anythingthey fit better than expected tighter around the buttock area but thats what i get for ordering under my normal size pockets are nice able to hold my s ultra with a case on it not a small phone so itll hold most anything from a phone to a wallet the pants do have standard rear pockets that appear to be able to hold a standard wallet rear pockets are about wallet height forward pockets can fit my entire hand up to my wrist just fine theyre not too wide though probably just enough to fit a phone and wallet ontop of each other and thats itthey feel sturdy enough to withstand most types of workthe only thing i dont like about the pants is the zipper its too long like twice as long as the normal zipper youd find on a pair of wranglers or something nothing thatll dissuade most buyers but i find zipping them all the way up to be kind of a pain could be that i ordered a size lower for sure so it might just be me will definitely buy again,1

"These Under Armour Assert 10s work well as casual work shoes, though they weren't quite up to the task when I started using them for actual running. The Charged Cushioning is comfortable for all-day standing and walking on hard floors, and the breathable mesh upper keeps your feet from overheating during long shifts.For work, the neutral support and lightweight design make them a solid choice. The durability is decent for everyday walking, and they clean up easily when they get dirty. The grip is good on most indoor surfaces, even when dealing with the occasional spill.However, when I started using them for running, their limitations became clear. The cushioning compresses pretty quickly under the impact of regular running, and the support isn't substantial enough for longer distances. After about 50 miles of running, they started to show noticeable wear in the midsole, and the responsiveness diminished significantly.Bottom line: great comfortable shoe for work or casual wear, but serious runners should look elsewhere for their training shoes. Think of these more as athletic-styled work shoes rather than dedicated running shoes.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​",these under armour assert s work well as casual work shoes though they werent quite up to the task when i started using them for actual running the charged cushioning is comfortable for allday standing and walking on hard floors and the breathable mesh upper keeps your feet from overheating during long shiftsfor work the neutral support and lightweight design make them a solid choice the durability is decent for everyday walking and they clean up easily when they get dirty the grip is good on most indoor surfaces even when dealing with the occasional spillhowever when i started using them for running their limitations became clear the cushioning compresses pretty quickly under the impact of regular running and the support isnt substantial enough for longer distances after about  miles of running they started to show noticeable wear in the midsole and the responsiveness diminished significantlybottom line great comfortable shoe for work or casual wear but serious runners should look elsewhere for their training shoes think of these more as athleticstyled work shoes rather than dedicated running shoes​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​,1

They weren't quite as flexible as I'd hoped, though they fit well and I've been happy with them. I'm able to wear them in my work setting and they look professional.They are wrinkle resistant, though I would say they fade just a bit easier than I'd hoped. That said, I'm a wheelchair user who is tough on clothing and these are holding up well. I would also say they are very true to sizing.Overall, I'm quite happy with these. There's no doubt I'll buy Amazon-branded clothing again, though I may go a size higher to get the needed flexibility. However, these are a good combination of solid quality and affordability and I definitely give them a thumbs up.",i recently had abdominal surgery related to cancer and was looking for a more flexible comfortable pair of pants in a size bigger than i usually wear im generally happy with amazonbranded items and have bought other clothing items from the amazon brandi actually bought four pairs of these pants theyre a mens classicfit wrinkleresistant pleated chino that i bought in a big  tall sizethese are definitely classic fit they werent quite as flexible as id hoped though they fit well and ive been happy with them im able to wear them in my work setting and they look professionalthey are wrinkle resistant though i would say they fade just a bit easier than id hoped that said im a wheelchair user who is tough on clothing and these are holding up well i would also say they are very true to sizingoverall im quite happy with these theres no doubt ill buy amazonbranded clothing again though i may go a size higher to get the needed flexibility however these are a good combination of solid quality and affordability and i definitely give them a thumbs up,1

"I purchased this brand because this is the same brand of underwear my partner has been wearing the last several years.But it seems their quality has gone down significantly in the last couple of years. In less than a month, every single pair has had the stitch income loose and has began to either drop the hem or open holes.I wanted to be refunded for them but Amazon seems to think to do that that I should gather up all the pairs of used underwear and drop them off to be returned and that's just insane.Do not buy these. And due to the fact that Amazon does not stand by anything they sell on their site anymore I would suggest no longer shopping here at all.

"I bought these because I wanted to find a new pair of shoes for work. I have mostly flat, wide feet and have always struggled finding sneakers in this style that aren‚Äôt narrow and binding around my toes. These were immediately comfortable right off the bat and they stretch to accommodate my feet. That being said, the material on top is not very thick, which is why it allows so much stretch and movement. I love that quality. So far they‚Äôve been my go to work shoes and they‚Äôre holding up well after a couple of weeks. Not much arch support so I‚Äôd consider an insole if your feet aren‚Äôt more on the flat side.

"I recently purchased the Levi's Men's 569 Loose Straight Fit Jeans for my husband, and they have quickly become his go-to pair of jeans. These jeans offer a perfect combination of comfort, style, and durability, making them ideal for everyday wear.First and foremost, the fit of the Levi's 569 jeans is excellent. The loose straight fit provides plenty of room through the seat and thigh, ensuring maximum comfort without being overly baggy. The jeans sit at the waist and offer a relaxed fit that my husband finds perfect for all-day wear. The straight leg opening is versatile and looks great with a variety of footwear, from sneakers to boots.The quality of the denim is impressive. Made from 100% cotton, the jeans are both durable and comfortable. The fabric is thick enough to withstand regular wear and tear while still being soft and flexible. This balance between durability and comfort ensures that the jeans hold up well over time and continue to look and feel great.The style of the Levi's 569 jeans is timeless and versatile. They have a classic five-pocket design with the signature Levi's stitching on the back pockets. The range of available washes allows for easy pairing with different outfits, whether for a casual day out or a more polished look. My husband particularly appreciates the darker wash for its ability to transition seamlessly from day to night.One of the standout features of these jeans is their practicality. The loose fit and straight leg make them suitable for a wide range of activities, from running errands to outdoor adventures. My husband finds them comfortable enough for all-day wear, whether he's working, relaxing, or engaging in more active pursuits.In terms of maintenance, the Levi's 569 jeans are easy to care for. They can be machine washed and dried without losing their shape or color. The high-quality construction ensures that they maintain their fit and appearance even after multiple washes.Another advantage of these jeans is their inclusive sizing. Levi's offers a wide range of sizes, ensuring that men of all shapes and sizes can find a comfortable and flattering fit. This inclusivity is particularly important for finding the perfect pair of jeans that not only look good but also feel great to wear.In summary, the Levi's Men's 569 Loose Straight Fit Jeans are an excellent choice for anyone looking for comfortable, stylish, and durable jeans. Their superior fit, high-quality denim, and timeless design make them a standout option for everyday wear. I highly recommend these jeans to anyone seeking a reliable and versatile addition to their wardrobe.

I think I’ll wash it by hand and see if that will save it from loosing vibrant color.,i really love this shirt  the fabric is nice and very comfortable and the style works very well  my only complaint is that it lost its vivid colors once washed i wash in cold water with tide and have never put it in the dryer  it is still wearable  but no longer vibrant  i bought the same shirt with  sleeves but have not worn it yet i think i’ll wash it by hand and see if that will save it from loosing vibrant color,1

I don't love the color on me, however, I want to send it back and get a different color. The only drawback I have is that the material, while stretchy and soft, is very obviously a T-shirt/jersey material and I feel like that is too casual for the black tie, super formal event I'm attending. I feel like a dark color would hide the casual material and fit in better for a formal event. Even in the coffee/beige color, I don't find it to be see through but wearing flesh-toned undergarments would be ideal. Oh!

"I bought a few similar jackets from different manufacturers and the plan was to keep the one that fit the best. This one came in second place, and I had to return it because another one fit me a little better. I ordered the small, and I am 5'6 tall and 150 lbs with short limbs and a wide frame. Nothing fits me well, so I usually have to settle for something that is close but not perfect. This jacket fit perfectly, but the sleeves and overall length were just a little bit longer than a competitor. I honestly would have kept this jacket if I had not tried the competitor's, because the extra length was negligible and comfortable. Generally speaking, this jacket style runs a little long in the sleeves for people like me with short arms. Then, if you buy a size extra-small (usually not available), it's too tight or too short in the overall length. This is a nice, well-constructed, lightweight jacket that feels warm. It's much lighter than a parka but it seems like it will work for cold and wet weather around 40-45 F. The hood also fits well without a hat and it seems like a very functional go-to jacket for cold rainy weather. The wrist elastic could be a little tighter in my opinion, but it's basically snug around the wrist. You can probably put a few stitches in the material and make it tighter with some clever sewing.",i bought a few similar jackets from different manufacturers and the plan was to keep the one that fit the best this one came in second place and i had to return it because another one fit me a little better i ordered the small and i am  tall and  lbs with short limbs and a wide frame nothing fits me well so i usually have to settle for something that is close but not perfect this jacket fit perfectly but the sleeves and overall length were just a little bit longer than a competitor i honestly would have kept this jacket if i had not tried the competitors because the extra length was negligible and comfortable generally speaking this jacket style runs a little long in the sleeves for people like me with short arms then if you buy a size extrasmall usually not available its too tight or too short in the overall length this is a nice wellconstructed lightweight jacket that feels warm its much lighter than a parka but it seems like it will work for cold and wet weather around  f the hood also fits well without a hat and it seems like a very functional goto jacket for cold rainy weather the wrist elastic could be a little tighter in my opinion but its basically snug around the wrist you can probably put a few stitches in the material and make it tighter with some clever sewing,1

With that said this is a great shirt if you don’t have a beer belly and want a shirt that fits to an athletic build. Other shirts I would have to buy a large to get the length I needed but then I would be drowning in them. Meaning you totally lose your physique.

"I really love this shirt. The polyester/rayon/spandex material is soft, comfortable, and feels great against your skin. The v neck showcases necklaces beautifully and does not show cleavage. The 3/4 sleeves end mid-forearm and have a nice lacy detail which gives the shirt a stylish look. I ordered my usual size (L), and it is true to size and a flattering fit. The length of the shirt allows it to be worn with leggings, but it will also pair nicely with jeans or a nice skirt. They offer this shirt in seven different colors; I ordered the wine color, and it runs more purple than red, but I really like it.",i really love this shirt the polyesterrayonspandex material is soft comfortable and feels great against your skin the v neck showcases necklaces beautifully and does not show cleavage the  sleeves end midforearm and have a nice lacy detail which gives the shirt a stylish look i ordered my usual size l and it is true to size and a flattering fit the length of the shirt allows it to be worn with leggings but it will also pair nicely with jeans or a nice skirt they offer this shirt in seven different colors i ordered the wine color and it runs more purple than red but i really like it,1
Kiddo is transitioning into 24 month clothes so ordered some more sleepers as I only had 2. The 2 we have are a different brand but fit perfectly. Got these amd they are huge. I tried to shrink them in the wash and they stayed their current size.

"I'm so sick of buying clothes online and having them not fit right. These shorts have redeemed my faith in online purchasing. I'm 5'-11, 185lbs, approx 33 waist. Bought a large and they looked huge when I pulled them out of the package, but when I put them on they fit like a glove. The elastic waist and stretchy fabric feels so nice. Seriously, when I squat down it's as if I'm wearing sweats. Since they have stretch, a large would also fit a larger waist, maybe even a smaller waist. But they look sturdy and as a professional landscape designer, I spend lots of time outside and need shorts in the summer that are cozy but also functional and somewhat professional (Seattle professional, that is). These fit that bill. Of course, when I say professional, I still like an urban and youthful flair. I'm 42 years old, and growing up in the 90s we don't be wearing short shorts, or shorts above the knee. These sit right below my kneecaps. They have a loose look and feel without looking overly baggy or ghetto. I like these a ton. I had a bad morning and weirdly, feeling these shorts on me, with their deep pockets that are great for wallets, phone, keys, etc., it truly brightened my day.",im so sick of buying clothes online and having them not fit right these shorts have redeemed my faith in online purchasing im  lbs approx  waist bought a large and they looked huge when i pulled them out of the package but when i put them on they fit like a glove the elastic waist and stretchy fabric feels so nice seriously when i squat down its as if im wearing sweats since they have stretch a large would also fit a larger waist maybe even a smaller waist but they look sturdy and as a professional landscape designer i spend lots of time outside and need shorts in the summer that are cozy but also functional and somewhat professional seattle professional that is these fit that bill of course when i say professional i still like an urban and youthful flair im  years old and growing up in the s we dont be wearing short shorts or shorts above the knee these sit right below my kneecaps they have a loose look and feel without looking overly baggy or ghetto i like these a ton i had a bad morning and weirdly feeling these shorts on me with their deep pockets that are great for wallets phone keys etc it truly brightened my day,1

I bought these for my 12 yr old son. He is very particular and rarely wears pants. I needed something that would feel similar to wearing basketball shorts and these fit the bill.

I've bought now 4 different sets of these shirts for my husband and myself. The white shirts I used for radiation treatment and it is true the darker colors do shrink or are a little smaller. So depending on the fit you want size up on darker colors if you want a looser fit. I bought both M and L and wear M more with things that can be seen more on the outside. So the L is more like a looser undershirt. The white t is good and loose for sleeping. Especially when I didn't want anything clinging to me.Only one flaw out of 4 different sets. I just fixed it on my serger.The shirts can be worn as under shirts or as shirts. All are a good medium weight quality and are soft. Better than a lot of the junk I find in retail stores now so happy with the quality. They last a long time and still look good.All are pretty wrinkle resistant and easy to clean.,ive bought now  different sets of these shirts for my husband and myself the white shirts i used for radiation treatment and it is true the darker colors do shrink or are a little smaller so depending on the fit you want size up on darker colors if you want a looser fit i bought both m and l and wear m more with things that can be seen more on the outside so the l is more like a looser undershirt the white t is good and loose for sleeping especially when i didnt want anything clinging to meonly one flaw out of  different sets i just fixed it on my sergerthe shirts can be worn as under shirts or as shirts all are a good medium weight quality and are soft better than a lot of the junk i find in retail stores now so happy with the quality they last a long time and still look goodall are pretty wrinkle resistant and easy to clean,1

"So, I'm a huge fan of the adidas lite racer series, you don't have to deal with laces and yet they stay firm on the foot. I wore various generations of them for years and have something to say. 3.0 are still the best in terms of design and fit in my opinion, but they are partially discontinued since the selection is extremely limited on amazon currently, so I had no choice but to find a replacement for them. 7.0's fit is decent, very soft and comfy. One aspect these excel in over previous generations is the outer sole. Lite racer series for a long time suffered from their main flaw, which was that the outer sole erodes very fast, 7.0's actually seem decent in this regard, looks like adidas finally addressed this issue. The single biggest issue with these shoes is quality control. I had to return a couple of them before I got an acceptable pair. There is a significant inconsistency in the way the insole is attached.",so im a huge fan of the adidas lite racer series you dont have to deal with laces and yet they stay firm on the foot i wore various generations of them for years and have something to say  are still the best in terms of design and fit in my opinion but they are partially discontinued since the selection is extremely limited on amazon currently so i had no choice but to find a replacement for them s fit is decent very soft and comfy one aspect these excel in over previous generations is the outer sole lite racer series for a long time suffered from their main flaw which was that the outer sole erodes very fast s actually seem decent in this regard looks like adidas finally addressed this issue the single biggest issue with these shoes is quality control i had to return a couple of them before i got an acceptable pair there is a significant inconsistency in the way the insole is attached,1

"I do a lot of walking and standing. I prefer a negative heel such as kelso earth shoes, but they stopped making them and those shoes don't have the heel cushion I prefer to protect impact heel pain.  The kelso earth negative heel is thier patent so I don't know of any other shoe makers that offer a negative heel.  These shoes have a slightly higher heel than the toe pad and have a lot of impact cushion for the heel. They have reasonable arch support.  Lots of room in the toe box. I like that they are real leather which will last a long time. They are as cute and fashionable as one can get while looking for this level of comfort and stability.  Most other shoes in this category have a higher heel, but those put more strain on the arch.  I think these are perfect for traveling and touring. They are not especially heavy or light but they do the job.",i do a lot of walking and standing i prefer a negative heel such as kelso earth shoes but they stopped making them and those shoes dont have the heel cushion i prefer to protect impact heel pain  the kelso earth negative heel is thier patent so i dont know of any other shoe makers that offer a negative heel  these shoes have a slightly higher heel than the toe pad and have a lot of impact cushion for the heel they have reasonable arch support  lots of room in the toe box i like that they are real leather which will last a long time they are as cute and fashionable as one can get while looking for this level of comfort and stability  most other shoes in this category have a higher heel but those put more strain on the arch  i think these are perfect for traveling and touring they are not especially heavy or light but they do the job,1

"I have purchased multiple Burt's bees pajamas in the past and have loved them for the kids. They definitely run tight so I typically order larger than the size I need. Because they are usually tight, they can be difficult to squeeze babies arms into. The fabric is soft and seems very comfortable for our kids. I did have a problem with this set of pajamas where after the first wash (before they were even worn) the bottom Hem of the shirt popped. I did cut the string and used the pajamas anyways. After the next wash the rest of the Hem came out along the bottom of the shirt. Obviously, the pajamas are still usable but it just stinks that the Hem popped after the first wash.",i have purchased multiple burts bees pajamas in the past and have loved them for the kids they definitely run tight so i typically order larger than the size i need because they are usually tight they can be difficult to squeeze babies arms into the fabric is soft and seems very comfortable for our kids i did have a problem with this set of pajamas where after the first wash before they were even worn the bottom hem of the shirt popped i did cut the string and used the pajamas anyways after the next wash the rest of the hem came out along the bottom of the shirt obviously the pajamas are still usable but it just stinks that the hem popped after the first wash,1

"I’m really impressed with this jacket! It’s super warm and perfect for the cold weather. I’ve worn it during several winter outings, and it keeps me cozy without being too bulky. The fit is great—true to size—and I love the sleek, modern design. The material feels durable, and the zippers and stitching are high quality. I also appreciate the functional pockets, especially the inside one for my phone.It’s not too heavy, so I can wear it all day without feeling weighed down. The jacket also does a good job of blocking out wind and rain, which is a huge plus. Overall, a great jacket for winter, and definitely worth the price.

"Iâ€™ve bought Hanes X-Temp shirts in the past on several occasions, and these are not them at all.

"Top is even prettier in person. Nicely made and looks more expensive than it was. Colors true to the photo. I purchased the one shown (black/tan). Fit is also true to size. I'm plus. I do not like my clothes SO snug that every bump shows, even though I'm fairly proportioned at 5'2 220.  I carry some middle weight in the tummy area and prefer to go up a size 2 or 3 x (depending on manufacturer). If American made, I usually take 1 x with complementary room but not so snug and not overwhelming. Fitted clothes are nice. Too tight looks just like that, and doesn't compliment, in my humble opinion.This top fits that bill. Nicely fitted with a good flow, but not overwhelming tight. Just right. It's quite attractive. The style with the gentle pleating, also makes most of slimming rather than adding pounds. A nice bonus.This top can definitely go well to a formal event, party or a nice dinner out.Recommend!",top is even prettier in person nicely made and looks more expensive than it was colors true to the photo i purchased the one shown blacktan fit is also true to size im plus i do not like my clothes so snug that every bump shows even though im fairly proportioned at    i carry some middle weight in the tummy area and prefer to go up a size  or  x depending on manufacturer if american made i usually take  x with complementary room but not so snug and not overwhelming fitted clothes are nice too tight looks just like that and doesnt compliment in my humble opinionthis top fits that bill nicely fitted with a good flow but not overwhelming tight just right its quite attractive the style with the gentle pleating also makes most of slimming rather than adding pounds a nice bonusthis top can definitely go well to a formal event party or a nice dinner outrecommend,1

"I got tired of my normal athletic shoes going bad from the stress of daily use on the job, so I went looking under the search term durable work shoes.  (Looking via Duck and Swisscows and Qwant, mind you, not via Amazon's own search fields, which, inexplicably, continue to be left as almost 100% useless.)Inevitably, nothing that was classified as a.) a shoe and b.) durable was available without a steel toe, so I relented and bought these.  For the record:  The heaviest thing I'm likely to drop on my feet is a disk of Lanthanum/Telluride alloy (or maybe Silicon/Germanium,) that's roughly the size, shape and weight of a U.S. Nickel, so I'm not really in need of steel-toed shoes.  But if you want durable, apparently you have to get the Medieval Class toe box, so I just bought them.I don't know if it's just the steel toe or a combination of that and the heavier-duty rubber and upper material, but these shoes are seriously heavy.  Not a big problem if you like the added exercise, but it would be great if shoe manufacturers would offer a version of the exact same work shoe with all of the exact same materials, but without the mëtal hardware.  But I knew that going in so...These are excellent shoes despite the weight.  I have wide feet and they're available in EE width (if they hadn't been I simply would not have bought them, because you can't be cool if your feet are uptight, as the old Hush Puppies ad used to say.)  They're built like tanks but are perfectly comfortable nonetheless, and I'm on my feet roughly 80% of every nine-hour workday.I got my normal size and width, and even with a pair of podiatrist-prescribed orthotic inserts and Odor-Eater pads, they fit perfectly.  When I put them on in the morning the toe areas do feel tight, but the inserts settle within minutes and they're a perfect fit thereafter.  So be aware that if you do not use any kind of insert these might be a little roomy.  The laces are also heavy-duty and the eyelets for them allow you to tighten them without messing with the loop-by-loop finger-pull thing - but neither do they let loose too easily - all of which I like lots.Given the excellent price, durability and fit, I'm really happy that I picked these.  Time will tell how well they'll hold up, but I've been wearing them on the job for two months and they still look and feel brand-new. I'm on hands and knees and crawling into the guts of systems and lab equipment frequently, and though the inevitable dirt is there, I don't even see so much as a scuff on the outer surfaces, anywhere.

"A few weeks ago, I began using them during my regular exercises, and since then, they have rapidly become my go-to pick for whatever physical events I may be participating in. The combination of black and green, which comes in a compact two-pack, gives my gym attire a splash of color and makes each training session a little bit more pleasurable. As soon as I put these shorts on for the first time, I believe that the quality of the cloth immediately stood out to me. Even during the most strenuous workouts or sprints at the gym, I am able to maintain my comfort thanks to the quick-dry material's outstanding efficiency in wicking away perspiration. Because of this function, I am able to concentrate fully on my performance without having to continually modify my outfit. I believe that this feature considerably lessens the pain that is caused by remaining wetness. The five-inch length provides the ideal combination between movement and coverage, according to the manufacturer. Squats and lunges are two examples of exercises that demand a complete range of motion, and I enjoy how the shorts allow for a lot of flexibility of movement. This is something that is crucial for activities like these. An additional benefit of the shorts is that they are made of a lightweight fabric, which guarantees that they do not weigh me down and contribute to a more easy and joyful training experience.",a few weeks ago i began using them during my regular exercises and since then they have rapidly become my goto pick for whatever physical events i may be participating in the combination of black and green which comes in a compact twopack gives my gym attire a splash of color and makes each training session a little bit more pleasurable as soon as i put these shorts on for the first time i believe that the quality of the cloth immediately stood out to me even during the most strenuous workouts or sprints at the gym i am able to maintain my comfort thanks to the quickdry materials outstanding efficiency in wicking away perspiration because of this function i am able to concentrate fully on my performance without having to continually modify my outfit i believe that this feature considerably lessens the pain that is caused by remaining wetness the fiveinch length provides the ideal combination between movement and coverage according to the manufacturer squats and lunges are two examples of exercises that demand a complete range of motion and i enjoy how the shorts allow for a lot of flexibility of movement this is something that is crucial for activities like these an additional benefit of the shorts is that they are made of a lightweight fabric which guarantees that they do not weigh me down and contribute to a more easy and joyful training experience,1

"Pleasantly surprised. So many compliments! Extremely flattering. Soft material. length appropriate for a funeral, and POCKETS that aren’t bulky and make your hips look bigger. I was extremely nervous and had yet to have luck with clothes from Amazon.  Paired it with heels and a simple necklace. Im 5’-7”, 160, and a 38C so I ordered an XL to accommodate my large bust and smaller waist. Fortunately the waist didn’t hang out under the bust to look like a tent. It actually accentuated my waist.

"I have always purchased my pants from Wally World...but over the years sizes have changed. I used to buy 30 inch inseam (length from crotch to floor). Now a size 30 inch inseam (the smallest W-W carries) goes 2 inches past my ankle. Also, I have to buy 36 inch waist and pants with a 36 inch waist and 30 inch inseam have wide hip and leg areas (this makes me look awful). I recently found pants on Amazon that were actually a 28 inch inseam and the waist was 34. This fit my waist and hips perfect, they didn't go past my shoes and the leg areas were not baggy. I was amazed!!!!! I'm 5' 7 tall and weight 160 and finally found pants that fit that frame (of mine) perfectly.

"I recently purchased the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co Men's Fit Flex Jeans in size 40, and I am absolutely thrilled with them. These jeans feel perfect in every way!First off, the fit is incredible. The size 40 fits me just right, providing comfort and flexibility without feeling too tight or too loose. The flex fabric allows for easy movement, making them perfect for all-day wear. Whether I’m sitting at my desk, running errands, or going out for the evening, these jeans stay comfortable and keep their shape.The look is classic and stylish. The design is versatile enough to pair with anything, from a casual t-shirt to a dressier button-down shirt. The quality of the material and stitching is evident, and they have a polished appearance that’s both modern and timeless.The price is fantastic, especially considering the quality you get with Levi Strauss. I’ve spent much more on other jeans that don’t come close to matching the comfort and durability of these. They’re an excellent value for the money, and I feel like I’m getting a premium product without the premium price tag.I should have gotten these jeans sooner. They’ve quickly become my go-to pair for any occasion, and I can’t believe I waited this long to try them. The combination of perfect fit, great look, and affordable price makes these jeans a standout purchase.Overall, the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co Men's Fit Flex Jeans are a fantastic buy.

I love the placement of the buttons, and they're stitched in well enough that I don't foresee them popping off in the wash any time soon.

"I was looking for something very inexpensive to get for my teenager's job interview endeavors. This was a great purchase. I bought two, one in large and one in medium because its so hard to know with buying clothes online if it will truly fit well. The medium fit him perfectly (with a tad bit of room to spare) so I bought a second pair in medium and returned the large. I love that if he were to gain ten pounds in the next two months (hopefully not but just saying) that these will still fit comfortably. Return process was easy. So far I recommend this seller and these pants, and I'll update later if we discover the quality wasn't as great our initial impression. The only downside to them was the material is the kind that dog and cat hair will stick to like a magnet but we use lint rollers so non issue. If you don't have pets no worries. If you do, don't let them get on ya before heading out. Put them on right before you leave and then you'll avoid hairy pants, lol. These are priced really well for the good features and fit. I did get them on sale and paid about $21 for them.

"The pants are long length; hubby is '5'7. Because the material is so silky, the legs cannot be rolled up with a cuff. For someone who does not walk, that's OK. But if you're short like my husband, and you ambulate, the pants will need to be cuffed/hemmed so as to avoid tripping on them when walking.  They wash well, dry well, no loss of color or elasticity of waistband.  Lightweight, pleasant looking, wears well (no ripped seams, etc. ) I gave them a 4* rating because without alteration, they are not suitable for shorter folks.",the pants are long length hubby is  because the material is so silky the legs cannot be rolled up with a cuff for someone who does not walk thats ok but if youre short like my husband and you ambulate the pants will need to be cuffedhemmed so as to avoid tripping on them when walking  they wash well dry well no loss of color or elasticity of waistband  lightweight pleasant looking wears well no ripped seams etc  i gave them a  rating because without alteration they are not suitable for shorter folks,1

"Awesome!!!  Here is how I buy clothes.1. I like low cost. a. Amazon is low cost.  And I don't have to drive 50 miles to the Outlet store.2. I buy the same clothes over and over.  Always the same sizes and colors for the basic items. a. I buy Champion long boxer briefs, preferably made in Vietnam. b. I buy sock from Johnston and Murphy. c. I buy t-Shirts (and most other items) from Brooks Brothers Outlet.Unfortunately, Johnston and Murphy's over the calf blue merino wool socks change over the year.  Double pipes at first, then single pipes close together, then triple pipes.  All I want is the same exact blue sock and same exact grey sock year after year so that I can avoid matching socks out of the clean clothes basket.  No, what should be the same exact sock is a big mix and match event every morning.  Same thing with Champion.  Why do I have to check to see what country they are made in before buying them.  Why can't I just trust that Champion underwear are the same the world over.3. I like high quality.  Here is how I define quality: a. Don't skimp on material. b. Long staple threads. c. Ergonomically cut.Every single sock manufacturer out there is skimping on material on socks.  Johnston and Murphy, Brooks Brothers, all shorter as the years go by.  They make them a quarter of an inch shorter.  It doesn't sound like a lot.  But I have to keep pulling up my new socks.  I never have to pull up my old socks.  How much money is being saved by cutting the socks a quarter inch shorter?Brooks Brothers t-shirts are still pretty good.  I have stuck with Brooks Brothers because every other t-shirt manufacturer that I've tried makes them an inch shorter, which means they come untucked.  Brooks Brothers t-shirts always stay tucked in.  And they don't pill after 10 washes.  I hate pilled t-shirts.  I hate them!Ergonomically cut: my mother bought me some gold toe socks.  I have big calves.  The elastic cut into my calves by the end of the day.  Five year old Johnston and Murphy socks are butter smooth.  The new ones are starting to cut with a sharp rigid thread around the top.  Brooks Brothers has a nice soft elastic at the top--if you buy the non-outlet variety--which go for $25 - $50 per pair.  That's a lot of money for socks when I like to keep 15 pair of blue and 15 pair of grey in the drawer after a full wash.  That would be like $750 - $1,500 for socks.  But the ergonomics on a sock make the difference between a beautiful day and a day that makes you feel like you've been sweating out in the sun.So, here is the scoop on the Amazon Essentials t-Shirts:1. Value: They are $16 for 6 shirt.  So, that's about $32 per year that I would spend on t-shirts.  That's Awesome!2. Consistency: Amazon gets it!  They actually advertises that they are not going to keep switching up.  You get the same thing every time.  I'm sure they will find a better way to make something and that a change will occur every now and then.  That's fine if they make an improvement.  But I'm betting it will not be changing the number of pipes running down my socks.  I'm sure other brands change the number of pipes because they found a factory in one country that makes they cheaper than in another country.  And they are not made to Johnston and Murphy's specs.  They are just  socks already being produced by another manufacturer at a lower cost than the last factory.3. Ergonomics: The t-shirts fit well.  From what I can tell so far, Amazon Essentials t-shirts use long staple cotton that will not pill.But all of this is really to communicate to Amazon.  Nice job with Amazon Essentials!  Would you *please* make some over-the-calf dress socks.  I will love you even more than I already do.  Please consider making long inseam boxer briefs that somehow keep the legs from riding up or don't start slipping down.  Also, I wear a lot of all cotton, non-iron dress shirts.  All cotton, non-iron, pleated, chino's would be awesome.  Long rise, gaberdine dress slacks would be great!  But, maybe I'm getting beyond the essentials with the slacks.  But please, the socks!  I hate every reasonable priced sock, that I've tried, that is made today.",awesome  here is how i buy clothes i like low cost a amazon is low cost  and i dont have to drive  miles to the outlet store i buy the same clothes over and over  always the same sizes and colors for the basic items a i buy champion long boxer briefs preferably made in vietnam b i buy sock from johnston and murphy c i buy tshirts and most other items from brooks brothers outletunfortunately johnston and murphys over the calf blue merino wool socks change over the year  double pipes at first then single pipes close together then triple pipes  all i want is the same exact blue sock and same exact grey sock year after year so that i can avoid matching socks out of the clean clothes basket  no what should be the same exact sock is a big mix and match event every morning  same thing with champion  why do i have to check to see what country they are made in before buying them  why cant i just trust that champion underwear are the same the world over i like high quality  here is how i define quality a dont skimp on material b long staple threads c ergonomically cutevery single sock manufacturer out there is skimping on material on socks  johnston and murphy brooks brothers all shorter as the years go by  they make them a quarter of an inch shorter  it doesnt sound like a lot  but i have to keep pulling up my new socks  i never have to pull up my old socks  how much money is being saved by cutting the socks a quarter inch shorterbrooks brothers tshirts are still pretty good  i have stuck with brooks brothers because every other tshirt manufacturer that ive tried makes them an inch shorter which means they come untucked  brooks brothers tshirts always stay tucked in  and they dont pill after  washes  i hate pilled tshirts  i hate themergonomically cut my mother bought me some gold toe socks  i have big calves  the elastic cut into my calves by the end of the day  five year old johnston and murphy socks are butter smooth  the new ones are starting to cut with a sharp rigid thread around the top  brooks brothers has a nice soft elastic at the topif you buy the nonoutlet varietywhich go for    per pair  thats a lot of money for socks when i like to keep  pair of blue and  pair of grey in the drawer after a full wash  that would be like    for socks  but the ergonomics on a sock make the difference between a beautiful day and a day that makes you feel like youve been sweating out in the sunso here is the scoop on the amazon essentials tshirts value they are  for  shirt  so thats about  per year that i would spend on tshirts  thats awesome consistency amazon gets it  they actually advertises that they are not going to keep switching up  you get the same thing every time  im sure they will find a better way to make something and that a change will occur every now and then  thats fine if they make an improvement  but im betting it will not be changing the number of pipes running down my socks  im sure other brands change the number of pipes because they found a factory in one country that makes they cheaper than in another country  and they are not made to johnston and murphys specs  they are just  socks already being produced by another manufacturer at a lower cost than the last factory ergonomics the tshirts fit well  from what i can tell so far amazon essentials tshirts use long staple cotton that will not pillbut all of this is really to communicate to amazon  nice job with amazon essentials  would you please make some overthecalf dress socks  i will love you even more than i already do  please consider making long inseam boxer briefs that somehow keep the legs from riding up or dont start slipping down  also i wear a lot of all cotton noniron dress shirts  all cotton noniron pleated chinos would be awesome  long rise gaberdine dress slacks would be great  but maybe im getting beyond the essentials with the slacks  but please the socks  i hate every reasonable priced sock that ive tried that is made today,1

I find these jeans are really comfortable.  I like a loser fit so these are perfect for me.  My only complaint is I ordered the light stone wash color twice.  The jeans look more like the dark stone wash color if you are comparing to the pictures on Amazon.  I thought maybe the first time they sent me the dark stone wash in error.  I kept them because I still like them.  I figured I would order another pair and then I would have one of each color.  The 2nd pair looks dark like the first pair.  I am not returning them because I love the fit.

"I’ve resisted trying “slip on” shoes because I didn’t feel like they could work as advertised. I was finally persuaded to try a pair by two of my sons who swear by them, and I chose this pair.

I wore them all day the first day without any need for break-in, and my feet were fine after I took them off. They’ve become my go-to casual shoes and a month after first wearing them they remain comfortable. They’ve stood up well in wet conditions and still look good.I will probably get another pair.

"First off, I'm 6'5"" (1.96 m), 200 lbs (91 kg) and have an athletic build. I ordered size Large Tall.The Fit: The fit is reasonably good. The shoulders fit very well, the chest has enough room. The body length is good and this is the first jacket I've had in a long time where the sleeves are sufficiently long. The sleeves also are large enough to be comfortable moving around. The mid-section doesn't fit as well. Like many tall sized clothes, the assumption seems to  be that if you're tall you must also be big. It would be nice if it came in an inch or two from the chest to just above the waist. This isn't as bad when wearing a sweatshirt or sweater, but when just wearing a t-shirt or dress shirt it is almost too big. I decided to keep it anyway because it's hard to find a tall jacket that is tall enough, and even though the mid-section is big, it doesn't look worse for it.Features: This is what you would expect from a softshell jacket. It is warm enough to work for temps just below freezing, maybe lower if you layer. It is not as wind resistant as I expected, but isn't bad. I haven't tried it in the rain yet. The pockets are large and insulated, so they will keep your hands warm.Overall it's a solid jacket.

"When it first arrived, I didn't like the feel of the fleece, it was dry and rough feeling - relatively speaking - for this type of fabric. A wash with some fabric softener made a lot of difference!I particularly like the length; it's long enough to extend several inches past my waist to avoid drafts from riding up if I bend over or lean forward.I am six feet tall, about 180 pounds, and I think it fits well. I do think I could fit into a medium, but I like having just a little room - more like a jacket than a sweater.Like all fleece, does a great job of holding on to loose dog hair.

"I have been wearing Calvin Klein for a long time and decided to try a bunch of new underwear.  This was the only cotton pair and I like them the second least.  They don't have the best fit and aren't as comfy as the others.  However, they were by far the cheapest, so for the price I will still give them 4 stars.  Quick comparisons to the other brands are below, ranked by my personal preference.1. Lululemon Always in Motion Boxer 5 Inch - 5 Stars: Easily the most comfortable, but pretty pricey.  The only pair that doesn't ride when moving around.2. Under Armour Men's Tech 6-inch Boxerjock 2-Pack - 4.5 Stars: Not quite as comfortable as Lululemon, but still pretty comfortable and more affordable.  Great at absorbing moisture but ride up your leg a bit sometimes.3. Calvin Klein - 4-5 Stars: I actually have a ton of these and don't remember the exact ones.  Some of them fit decently well, and some not so much. On average they are pretty decent though4. ExOfficio Men's Give-n-go Boxer Brief - 3.5 Stars: These are... fine.  They are middle of the road in comfort and good at absorbing moisture.  But for the price there are just way better options.5. Pair of Thieves Super Fit Underwear for Men Pack - 2 & 3 Pack Boxer Briefs - AMZ Exclusive - 3.5 Stars: These are weird.  Super comfy when dry, but terrible moisture absorption.  When even slightly wet they are super uncomfortable.  Definitely don't plan to sweat in these.6. Pair of Thieves Cotton Boxer Briefs for Men Pack (4 Pack) - 4 Stars:  Not as comfortable as all of the non-cotton options, but a decent value.7.

The suede upper gives them a more polished, versatile look, which works well with both casual outfits and a bit more dressed-up styles.What’s also great is how easy they are to slip on and off—perfect for a busy tween who’s always on the go. The fit is true to size, and they’ve held up really well even with regular use.

"This is a great jacket. Lots of pockets and whatever the shell is made of it is both wind and rain resistant. You are as snug as a bug.But the sizing is small. Amazon told me to get an XL, and while it fits, it fits “fitted”. I have braid shoulder and it is very tight on me. If it under 35 degrees you will feel the cold and because it is so snug you can’t wear anything thicker then a t shirt. AND the zipper is on the wrong side. Not a big deal but it definitely needs some getting used to.I returned this one and got a size upEdit: I ended up returning the XXL because it was too big. Maybe I’m used to the feel of this one.

"The Fruit of the Loom Men's Coolzone Boxer Briefs are great value for anyone seeking comfortable, breathable, and affordable underwear.The boxer shorts are made from soft, breathable cotton that feels good against the skin.

"The pants arrived on time nicely packaged in plastic and a box. The size 48x32 was correct in both places, on the sticker as well as the sewn in tag denoting made in Mexico. I’m 5’10”, 270 lbs and coming down in weight and from a 50” waist  line. Hence, the 48x32. Having enough room in the thighs has always been an issue, but not with the Wrangler Rustler Classic Relaxed Fit. These fit true to size! 48” inches is comfortably perfect and the length was spot on! There was comfortable room throughout the thighs, crotch and seat! The quality of the denim is on par with my favorite Big & Tall store brand jeans without the $60+ price tag! The color of the dark rinse was even throughout, NO blotches or discoloration whatsoever. All the seams were straight, smooth and evenly sewn. I counted 9 belt loops vs 8 on my fav old jeans. If I had to nit pick, it would be the size of the pockets. The Rustler has slightly smaller pockets but not by more than 1/2-1 inch in most directions except for the depth of the back pockets, not a deal breaker, since I don’t prefer many items in pockets as a rule, but deduct 1 star. However, the exceptional price point of this high quality Wrangler Rustler Classic Relaxed Fit Jean restored my overall rating to 5 Stars! At this time it’s an excellent buy for myself as I endeavor to keep getting smaller. Will definitely be a go to jean for future consideration!

Very warm with plenty of pockets. Stayed comfortable in 20 degree snow while hiking. The only things I noticed were that the hood is hard to get over your head if you're wearing a beanie but the hood is also removable if need be and the lower pocket zippers have flaps designed to keep them dry but sometimes get caught in the zipper when zipping up. Not a big issue and easy to overlook given the quality and performance of the jacket. For the money I highly recommend. My Canadian father complimented on it so it has to be good!,very warm with plenty of pockets stayed comfortable in  degree snow while hiking the only things i noticed were that the hood is hard to get over your head if youre wearing a beanie but the hood is also removable if need be and the lower pocket zippers have flaps designed to keep them dry but sometimes get caught in the zipper when zipping up not a big issue and easy to overlook given the quality and performance of the jacket for the money i highly recommend my canadian father complimented on it so it has to be good,1
"I originally bought these for my son to wear to school, he had gained a little bit of weight and he mentioned not wanting jogger elastic around his ankles. He didn't like the way they fit.

I have washed them in cool water and dried them in the dryer. They have come out fairly unwrinkled and no pilling.I am 0 230 lb and 5 ft. 3. I bought a size 2XL.

Husband loves them. Comfy and go through the wash easily. Not as thick as other sweatpants but great for around the house or in warmer climates.

"Buying clothes online can often be disappointing.  Not being able to see  and feel garments is always a roll of the dice.  Very happy to say this shirt was an absolute win.The shirt came in a tiny box. That threw me for a second, but I now applaud the Eco- packaging.  No pins,  no cardboard etc.  Shirt was cleanly sealed in a plastic bag with zero wrinkles.QUALITY: Very well made, with perfect even seams and stitching.  Nicely finished collar.  Tight buttons.MATERIAl:  Soft stretchy polyester and spandex blend. Almost feels like cotton.  Great feature for outdoors: UPF 30.  Besides being nearly wrinkle free,  another nice plus is wicking shirts dry fast.  I travel a lot and sometimes run out of clothes.  Being able to hand wash a few items and have them dry quickly (and still look presentable) is always appreciated.  Especially when packing light for long international travel.FIT  Because it's stretchy- ideal as active wear, and not just golf.  Happy to report the shirt was true to size.  Something that's always a challenge with many other imported shirts.LOOK:  Firm collar, and flattering fit.  M MAELREG  has their logo tastefully ironed on the sleeve.  I chose the Grey, which was more of an off-white.  It has multi grey and pink stripes.  Other reviews stated some other colors were a bit too neon.  Luckily, the stripes on the grey are subtle and keeps the shirt understated. .FEEL:  I'm a fan of breathing-wicking shirts.  Especially in the hot humid South during summer.  Polo shirts are the  equivalent of a Woman's little black dress.  Casual, but the collar still keeps them dressy enough for just about anything. This shirt can easily be dressed up worn under a sport coat.  Another essential for travel.Negatives:  None to speak of.  Usual slight finishing odor.  I wash everything before wearing so no complaints.  I would of liked more of a choice of primary solid colors or variations.All in all, very nice shirt and good comparative value to similar polo shirts.  Very pleased.",buying clothes online can often be disappointing  not being able to see  and feel garments is always a roll of the dice  very happy to say this shirt was an absolute winthe shirt came in a tiny box that threw me for a second but i now applaud the eco packaging  no pins  no cardboard etc  shirt was cleanly sealed in a plastic bag with zero wrinklesquality very well made with perfect even seams and stitching  nicely finished collar  tight buttonsmaterial  soft stretchy polyester and spandex blend almost feels like cotton  great feature for outdoors upf   besides being nearly wrinkle free  another nice plus is wicking shirts dry fast  i travel a lot and sometimes run out of clothes  being able to hand wash a few items and have them dry quickly and still look presentable is always appreciated  especially when packing light for long international travelfit  because its stretchy ideal as active wear and not just golf  happy to report the shirt was true to size  something thats always a challenge with many other imported shirtslook  firm collar and flattering fit  m maelreg  has their logo tastefully ironed on the sleeve  i chose the grey which was more of an offwhite  it has multi grey and pink stripes  other reviews stated some other colors were a bit too neon  luckily the stripes on the grey are subtle and keeps the shirt understated feel  im a fan of breathingwicking shirts  especially in the hot humid south during summer  polo shirts are the  equivalent of a womans little black dress  casual but the collar still keeps them dressy enough for just about anything this shirt can easily be dressed up worn under a sport coat  another essential for travelnegatives  none to speak of  usual slight finishing odor  i wash everything before wearing so no complaints  i would of liked more of a choice of primary solid colors or variationsall in all very nice shirt and good comparative value to similar polo shirts  very pleased,1

"I always thought these types of shoes looked a little goofy. It was mostly my disdain for leather shoes seeing as I live in the desert and that the maintenance on these was wild to me.I'm not a man that takes great care of his footwear, nor am I one to be a shoefile. To me, footwear is to be used and abused.Having said that, as a dad, lately I've been finding it hard to look put together in my footwear, I wear mostly boots, and black runners to keep life simple. But these are darn cozy shoes. Warm in the evening, confidence inspiring during social events, even the wife complimented my increased dad appeal. Buying these on a cyber Monday whim to keep my gym shoes to the gym and family walks, boots to the outdoors and other Western dresses, and these to have on those casual but look good type of days.I'm really impressed with the overall comfort, the weight is inbetween light and heavy, but they don't fatigue my feet, leaving plenty of the room, I like that they stay on and don't slip off the heel being high tops, harder to get on fully laced but I'm still very much function over form in the fashion department so I don't intend to wear them as the younger more hip crowd tends to.The design is timeless, and quality seems well built, so I expect these to go out of style before I need another pair.On a sale, they were a great value and I'm very excited to try something kind of new for me.Plus side is the fact that the white is almost nuclear. In the dead of night these things practically light the path for me.",i always thought these types of shoes looked a little goofy it was mostly my disdain for leather shoes seeing as i live in the desert and that the maintenance on these was wild to meim not a man that takes great care of his footwear nor am i one to be a shoefile to me footwear is to be used and abusedhaving said that as a dad lately ive been finding it hard to look put together in my footwear i wear mostly boots and black runners to keep life simple but these are darn cozy shoes warm in the evening confidence inspiring during social events even the wife complimented my increased dad appeal buying these on a cyber monday whim to keep my gym shoes to the gym and family walks boots to the outdoors and other western dresses and these to have on those casual but look good type of daysim really impressed with the overall comfort the weight is inbetween light and heavy but they dont fatigue my feet leaving plenty of the room i like that they stay on and dont slip off the heel being high tops harder to get on fully laced but im still very much function over form in the fashion department so i dont intend to wear them as the younger more hip crowd tends tothe design is timeless and quality seems well built so i expect these to go out of style before i need another pairon a sale they were a great value and im very excited to try something kind of new for meplus side is the fact that the white is almost nuclear in the dead of night these things practically light the path for me,1

"This is for the women looking to buy these shirts for themselves:Just this summer, I started getting heat rash on my abdominal area like nothing I've ever experienced before. I'd get it here and there, but on day at a theme park I was in a panic with large red welts all up to my neck, and they burned.Last week, I decided to wear a long sleeve under my work shirt on a cold morning. Even though I got warm throughout the day, that was the first day I did not experience heat rash.So I bought these to have a few on hand. These are incredibly comfortable out of the package. They are loose but lightweight under t shirts. The temperature reached 82 degrees today, and I was wearing one of these under cotton shirt, thick jeans as well and I wasn't sweating or uncomfortable at ALL. I'm used to sweating easily.I have not experienced hives since wearing these to regulate my body temp.I ordered a size small. For reference I have 27 waist and 36 inch bust. The small perfect. If you are smaller than me they might be too large on you. The fabric is see through but for my use, that's okay.

They look great (blue and orange edition) and they don't smell after multiple uses. I have worn them for running and around the house while working remotely and they feel amazing.

"Took me three tries to get this jacket but thanks to Amazon's easy return policy I finally got it and there's a lot to love about it.  First, I ordered a Large because that's what I wear.  The sleeves are really long to the point there was no way I could keep that size so I exchanged for a Med.  The Med. arrived a couple days later and the zipper was broken.  Not just hard to get on and off as I expected that, but the zipper was literally bent to the point where I had to take the jacket off over my head and pry the zipper enough to finally get it open.  So, returned it, replacement arrived a few days later and it was right as rain.Sleeves are still a tad long but I'm fine with that and there is enough space in the jacket for a sweater underneath for layering.  The washed fabric feels much more broken in than the standard Carhartt which I really appreciate.  While rated a 2 in warmness on their bizarre rating scale, this jacket is extremely warm.  It has been around 30 degrees in my area lately and I get toasty in this thing.  The pockets are great,  The interior left chest zipper packet and right side chest velcro pocket were must haves for me and are a welcome addition.  Also, I ordered the attachable hood here on Amazon for $25.00 bucks.  One of my wants was a jacket that didn't have an attached hood and this is one of the few that Carhartt offers.  It is odd to me that for 25 bucks more they don't just include it with the jacket but whatever.  Zipper is somewhat stiff as others have mentioned but once you find the sweet spot of getting it on, you get the hang of it and it becomes second nature.All in all I really like this jacket and hope that it lasts me a very long time.  4/5 stars simply because I don't just throw out 5 stars unless something really blows me away.  This is technically a 4.5 because it's exactly what I was looking for.  Highly recommended.",took me three tries to get this jacket but thanks to amazons easy return policy i finally got it and theres a lot to love about it  first i ordered a large because thats what i wear  the sleeves are really long to the point there was no way i could keep that size so i exchanged for a med  the med arrived a couple days later and the zipper was broken  not just hard to get on and off as i expected that but the zipper was literally bent to the point where i had to take the jacket off over my head and pry the zipper enough to finally get it open  so returned it replacement arrived a few days later and it was right as rainsleeves are still a tad long but im fine with that and there is enough space in the jacket for a sweater underneath for layering  the washed fabric feels much more broken in than the standard carhartt which i really appreciate  while rated a  in warmness on their bizarre rating scale this jacket is extremely warm  it has been around  degrees in my area lately and i get toasty in this thing  the pockets are great  the interior left chest zipper packet and right side chest velcro pocket were must haves for me and are a welcome addition  also i ordered the attachable hood here on amazon for  bucks  one of my wants was a jacket that didnt have an attached hood and this is one of the few that carhartt offers  it is odd to me that for  bucks more they dont just include it with the jacket but whatever  zipper is somewhat stiff as others have mentioned but once you find the sweet spot of getting it on you get the hang of it and it becomes second natureall in all i really like this jacket and hope that it lasts me a very long time   stars simply because i dont just throw out  stars unless something really blows me away  this is technically a  because its exactly what i was looking for  highly recommended,1

"Okay, so I needed some new workout shirts, and these Real Essentials ones seemed like a pretty good deal. Five shirts for that price?

Just a nice athletic fit. * Comfort: The material is surprisingly soft and comfortable. It's lightweight and breathable, perfect for working out. * Performance:  They definitely wick away sweat. I wore one to the gym the other day and it kept me dry throughout my workout.  No more soaking wet cotton shirts! * Value:  You really can't beat the price for five shirts. It's a great value, especially if you're on a budget.The Not-So-Good: * Durability:  They seem a little thin. I'm a bit worried they might not hold up well after multiple washes. Only time will tell. * Color Selection: The colors were a bit basic. Would be nice to have some more vibrant options.Overall:For the price, these Real Essentials active t-shirts are a solid buy.

"THIS IS UNBELIEVEABLE! I normally do not give an opinion on a product the very same day it arrives, as I like to use/wear it awhile first, before I decide if I like the product  or not. However, I was so overjoyed with what Amazon delivered today, that I could not wait.  I am a short person, 5'0 short, who has searched my entire adult life for jeans that fit properly. One year, many years ago, before school started, we, as we had done for years, went to the only store (a small family owned store) that carried the uniforms required by the parochial schools in our metro area. As the sales/ fitting lady helped our 3 daughters, I asked her if I could try on some jeans.  She was kept busy, helping my girls fit  their uniforms and mark them at the right places, where the seamstress would take them in. I wasn't aware that everytime I came out of the dressing room and looked into the 3 way mirror, that she was watching me. When I had tried on every jean they had out for sale, as was usual, ALL of them were way too long by than 6 inches or more. Running into a dead end, so to speak, as I usually did with jeans, I put them back where I had found them and hung them up. I returned to see how my daughters fittings were going. She looked like she had something to say, but was hesitating. When she spoke she said, I don't mean to be a busybody, but I noticed that the jeans we have for sale were all way too long for you. May I make a suggestion for you to try? I told her she should tell me what she wanted to say. She informed me that the size jean I needed in a junior sizing, would ALL be way too long, unless I was lucky enough (at the time) to find someone who carried Petites. I asked off hand, if she knew of anyone who carried them at the time. She told me no, but that she thought I would get a perfect fit, and here she inserted,I hope I don't offend you by saying this, but I think a girls size 14 would be perfect for you. She pointed the way. Having nothing to lose, I tried her suggestion. It was as though I had found custom fitted jeans! I chose a few pair, and from then on, I always went to the girls department when I needed any sort of pant.  This past year, my jeans looked like they had seen their day. As I wanted to try some in the beautiful colors they now make, I looked at 2 of the better known, name brand jeans that were out there. I found almost NOTHING, in the size I needed, but even if it wasn't a color I would normally have chosen, I purchased the few I found offered and in stock, who claimed to fit according to the chart, between a 2 Petite and a 4 Petite. When they came, many were still way too long and the rest that were that was the right length, then the hips and waist were way too big. But beggars can't be choosers so they say, and I kept the ones that fit best lengthwise. The more I thought about it, after washing and wearing the 6 or so pair I had kept, I had kept, I recalled seeing  a picture of Amazons jeans for petite women, on one of the pages where I had ordered the jeans I now had. I decided to give them a try. I purchased 2 pair, as that would give me more jeans than I needed, but a little bit of summery color. They came today.  These are THE BEST jeans, fit wise, fabric wise and color wise, I have ever owned in my 64 years. I am NOT joking when I say that, for the first time ever, I was elated! I now have 2 pair of jeans that look and fit as though custom made. I only wish I hadn't washed and worn the name brand jeans that are ill fitting. The quality really surprised me, as the fabric was soft, supple and the jeans are very well constructed. Length is perfect. And, they are perfectly fitted to my hips and waist, not needing a belt. The next time I need or decide to buy jeans again, I am going straight to Amazon's page and place my order. And so many color choices for me! For the very first time, I have a choice of EVERY color they make, in all the larger sizes of the name brand jeans, but rarely, if ever in my size or length. I am in heaven! For a woman my age who has put up with either a poor color choice because the store does not buy large quantities of the 2 smallest sizes, and they go fast IF they carry them at all, or having to choose jeans that are too big in the hips and/or waist, I now have two VERY well made, VERY lovely looking pairs of jeans, that no one would ever know they aren't one of the name brands. Thank you Amazon!  I have waited my entire life, to find pretty colored, well fitting, well made jeans that up until now, I had to compromise on something, to wear. These jeans are perfect! A perfect fit. Perfect colors and sturdy construction. I will forget about those name brand jeans, (and their price) and head straight to Amazons jeans page. I KNOW I won't be disappointed.

I have neuropathy in my feet so it's important that a shoe feels like it's hugging my whole foot and these really fit the bill.

"I took the nudge from other reviewers and sized down and I'm thrilled with the fit of these jeans.Currently I normally buy and fit well in a size 12 jean. I ordered these LEE women's ultra LUX comfort flex jeans in a size 10 and the fit is like a glove and comfortable.They are (for jeans) VERY stretchy but don't seem like grandma jeans.The color is deep and rich. I haven't washed them yet but will probably wash them with black or other jeans and only in cold water. I doubt they'll shrink due to the cotton/poly content though possibly slightly in length which is sufficient (I'm 5' 5)My only complaint so far is that the front pockets are SHALLOW. That's so annoying because basically they're not functional pockets unless you carry a tissue or a quarter in them. Give me some real pockets here please.Now back to the fit.I'm hour or pear shaped and have thick thighs and a smaller waist.These are a beautiful fit for someone like myself who has thighs and a smaller waistThe waistband is super stretchy; it's different than any jeans waistband I've had and I'm not complaining about it. It does not look like an elastic waist and comes up above my belly button hugging all my curves nicely.If you have thin thighs these will probably fit  looser in the thigh area. I wouldn't mind that but that's not how I'm built.I Like the flair leg bottomThese will definitely stretch as you wear them which , for me, is another reason I'm glad I sized down to the 10. I don't like having my pants falling down so that I have to shimmy them up all day. I think these will stay put as well as give me a freedom to move.The price tag at 27 ish dollars is great too. I'm very happy with them so far and once I wear them for a bit will probably get another pair.Will update if needed but for now I recommend these jeans.They fit like a glove and feel good on while hugging my curves give me freedom to move.",i took the nudge from other reviewers and sized down and im thrilled with the fit of these jeanscurrently i normally buy and fit well in a size  jean i ordered these lee womens ultra lux comfort flex jeans in a size  and the fit is like a glove and comfortablethey are for jeans very stretchy but dont seem like grandma jeansthe color is deep and rich i havent washed them yet but will probably wash them with black or other jeans and only in cold water i doubt theyll shrink due to the cottonpoly content though possibly slightly in length which is sufficient im  my only complaint so far is that the front pockets are shallow thats so annoying because basically theyre not functional pockets unless you carry a tissue or a quarter in them give me some real pockets here pleasenow back to the fitim hour or pear shaped and have thick thighs and a smaller waistthese are a beautiful fit for someone like myself who has thighs and a smaller waistthe waistband is super stretchy its different than any jeans waistband ive had and im not complaining about it it does not look like an elastic waist and comes up above my belly button hugging all my curves nicelyif you have thin thighs these will probably fit  looser in the thigh area i wouldnt mind that but thats not how im builti like the flair leg bottomthese will definitely stretch as you wear them which  for me is another reason im glad i sized down to the  i dont like having my pants falling down so that i have to shimmy them up all day i think these will stay put as well as give me a freedom to movethe price tag at  ish dollars is great too im very happy with them so far and once i wear them for a bit will probably get another pairwill update if needed but for now i recommend these jeansthey fit like a glove and feel good on while hugging my curves give me freedom to move,1

"Army green. I really like the look of these pants with the front pleats and adjustable waist.  I’d say the most common compliment with these is, “You look dapper!“. I imagine there would eventually be some fabric piling. I wanted to provide close-up pictures of the texture and color, which does have relatively few loose fibers compared to other Paul Jones tweeds, and is a most single hue of dark forest green with black herringbone.  In other words, this is a NOT a multicolor herringbone. I wanted to make a full suit out of it, as I am obsessed with forest green suits currently. However, it appears that all of the blazers which are sold as army green are multicolor. They also have a slightly wider width to the herringbone pattern. The final picture shows them next to each other, with the pants being a much darker green compared to the blazers, which have a lot more golden yellow fibers in them. The texture is also different, with the blazers, having somehow a slightly smoother feel despite having more loose fibers on the surface, while the pants have a slightly more burlap feel to them. It would be nice to offer pants  that match a blazer for a full suit look for those who want one.",army green i really like the look of these pants with the front pleats and adjustable waist  i’d say the most common compliment with these is “you look dapper“ i imagine there would eventually be some fabric piling i wanted to provide closeup pictures of the texture and color which does have relatively few loose fibers compared to other paul jones tweeds and is a most single hue of dark forest green with black herringbone  in other words this is a not a multicolor herringbone i wanted to make a full suit out of it as i am obsessed with forest green suits currently however it appears that all of the blazers which are sold as army green are multicolor they also have a slightly wider width to the herringbone pattern the final picture shows them next to each other with the pants being a much darker green compared to the blazers which have a lot more golden yellow fibers in them the texture is also different with the blazers having somehow a slightly smoother feel despite having more loose fibers on the surface while the pants have a slightly more burlap feel to them it would be nice to offer pants  that match a blazer for a full suit look for those who want one,1

I've purchased several Nautica products from retail stores and have never been disappointed. However these are more like a slim fit design. Too tight especially in the thighs. And the material is paper thin  unlike any Nautica product I've ever had. I suspect these boxers as well as a lot of clothes on here are ones that didn't pass quality control and the manufacturers are dumping them on here knowing most people don't bother with the hassle of returns.

"it is a pack of 6 boxers. Note that when I take it out of the bag, in the bathroom, the boxer can almost be kind of see through, so they are pretty thin. Depending on the circumstances, such as you want them to be thin or if it is for summer days when you are wearing shorts, then maybe it is a good thing.Also note that there are some loose threads when you first take them out.

"It was very well packaged. The entire belt has a protective sleeve over it, and then there is plastic shrink wrapped on the metal parts to keep them from getting scratched. Then the whole belt is put in a nice sturdy box. Also included is a hole puncher in case you need to add holes to the belt. That was a nice surprise. It is a very soft leather belt. I think it’s the perfect way to go with a pair of jeans or even a nice pair of dress pants. The three loops that the belt goes through when closing it adds a nice touch to it. Usually you just have one loop for the belt to go through, but they gave you two leather loops and a metal loop in between them.",it was very well packaged the entire belt has a protective sleeve over it and then there is plastic shrink wrapped on the metal parts to keep them from getting scratched then the whole belt is put in a nice sturdy box also included is a hole puncher in case you need to add holes to the belt that was a nice surprise it is a very soft leather belt i think it’s the perfect way to go with a pair of jeans or even a nice pair of dress pants the three loops that the belt goes through when closing it adds a nice touch to it usually you just have one loop for the belt to go through but they gave you two leather loops and a metal loop in between them,1

"If you're searching for a tracksuit you can wear regularly, I strongly suggest looking elsewhere. The collars around the wrists and ankles are uncomfortably chunky and the overall quality (and leatherette type print, which I missed in the images) is very poor. 97% polyester, super hot not breathable. Admittedly, I didn't think I needed to review the fabric content for a tracksuit prior to ordering. My mistake.Overall, I'll never wear this again, but at least it fits as expected. Don't be a dummy like me, do more research. Even the drawstrings are terrible!

"They put these on our newborn at the hospital and I had to order some for at home. They are perfect for night time diaper changes. It is a bit big for my girl at 1 month old but she’ll grow into it yet. Long enough to cover legs when she’s stretched out. Cute, good quality material.

"I bought this dress for a casual picnic style wedding. I knew I wanted a bold summer color, something lightweight so I wouldn't be sweating all afternoon. Most importantly, I wanted a dress to highlight my recent 40 pound weight loss, and my  regained self confidence.I am 5 ft, now 152 lbs. As its been a very long time since I've been this weight, I was very unsure what size to order. And since I wear a 36DDD/F bra, that makes it even more difficult to find clothes that fit right.First I ordered a XL, which was much too large everywhere. But I knew this was the dress I wanted! I exchanged it for a Large, but it was still slightly too big, so I sent it back for a Medium, which thankfully was perfect!I have never minded showing off the girls and this dress allows just a touch of sexiness without being inappropriate. (NOTE- I did have to order a plunge style  bra so the center wouldn't show in the small opening beneath the knot).The Rose Red color is beautiful, and must be the It color this summer! I actually saw many women wearing almost identical colors, or similar pinks!It was 80°, no shade at all where the ceremony was held,  and the lightweight material kept me comfortable the whole time. It has a 2nd thin layer underneath, similar to a built in slip. It helps ensure comfort, but also helps prevents panty lines.The flowing sleeves give it a fun and flirty touch, making the dress very versatile.  It can be worn for Ladies night, date night. I paired it with bright pink lace up sandals, and matching earrings, or the dress alone could be the focal point, worn with nude shoes, and simple jewelry.After struggling with my weight for years, this is the first time I've been able to dress up and feel good about myself. Being able to fit into a size Medium after wearing a 2XL for this long, and finding this gorgeous dress that looks so flattering, made me feel so confident.My only recommendation; I don't ever really iron, (I think I've probably ironed 2x in the last 8 years lol), but it couldn't have hurt. The dress arrived about 3 or 4 days before the wedding and I had it hanging in my closet until the day of. I definitely won't say that it wrinkles easily. It lasted the whole wedding without a single crease appearing. But I could have run a warm iron over it to get the wrinkles out from shipping, and I'll have to see how it looks after I wash and line dry it. I suspect it may require a quick iron to smooth it out. But well worth it for such a beautiful dress.Great quality for a great price. Sheer perfection. This is THE summer dress for any occasion!Do not hesitate to buy this.

"These are my favorite shoes & these are my second pair. Only reason I replaced the first pair is cus I wore them down being lazy and shoving my feet into them without untying them. The heels are torn on the inside but this would have been avoided if I had taken better care of them. Totally on me. Everything else about old ones is still solid, comfortable, and supportive. They're leather so they don't rip or tear. Remarkably comfortable. I bought them because they were recommended for plantar fasciitis pain & wide toe box. Completely got rid of my pain & my feet no longer feel cramped.I will say the wear in period was a little weird. They are pretty stiff right out of the box and certainly take a few days to wear in. They are also not super breathable and until they wear in my feet are prone to get a little too hot. This goes away fastI fully expect this pair to last several years of all day every day wear.

"For many years, I have purchased standard shrink to fit 501 Levi's and needed a couple new pair of 36W x 34L pants.  These appear to be very similar to what I have purchased many times.  First, I was sure to purchase the New Rigid color.  These are the heaviest and most basic without any additional washing or processing.  They are also the best price (approximately $50).  I have not seen any difference in the thickness or weight of the fabric.  These are rigid and take time to become soft and flexible, which is what they will be after wearing them for awhile and having several washings.  There are a lot of stickers on the product, which I have attached.While the Amazon listing indicates these are made in Mexico, the sewn0on label indicates the country of origin is Indonesia.  The reality may be that various parts of the product are likely made in various countries, including where the cotton is grown, where the raw cotton is made into fabric, where the fabric is processed,  where the thread is made, where the buttons are made, where the product is sewn, and finally where the product is inspected.  This is just modern day manufacturing.  Only time will tell if I get the same wear life on these as I have on others I have owned.I notice that on the Levi's website, they indicate a shrink allowance of 1 on the waist and 3 on the length for this size, but the label on these indicates 2 on both the waist and the length.  So, we will see which is correct.  In the past, I have always followed the 1 - 3 specification for this size.",for many years i have purchased standard shrink to fit  levis and needed a couple new pair of w x l pants  these appear to be very similar to what i have purchased many times  first i was sure to purchase the new rigid color  these are the heaviest and most basic without any additional washing or processing  they are also the best price approximately   i have not seen any difference in the thickness or weight of the fabric  these are rigid and take time to become soft and flexible which is what they will be after wearing them for awhile and having several washings  there are a lot of stickers on the product which i have attachedwhile the amazon listing indicates these are made in mexico the sewnon label indicates the country of origin is indonesia  the reality may be that various parts of the product are likely made in various countries including where the cotton is grown where the raw cotton is made into fabric where the fabric is processed  where the thread is made where the buttons are made where the product is sewn and finally where the product is inspected  this is just modern day manufacturing  only time will tell if i get the same wear life on these as i have on others i have ownedi notice that on the levis website they indicate a shrink allowance of  on the waist and  on the length for this size but the label on these indicates  on both the waist and the length  so we will see which is correct  in the past i have always followed the    specification for this size,1
