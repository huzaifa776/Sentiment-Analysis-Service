"I can't find any faults in these loafers. They're very well made, comfortable, and very versatile. I noticed the tag on mine had some extra information on it about the Good Year soles and I found out that they're non-slip soles. That's just perfect for our Midwestern icy grounds. As I get older I'm leaning more towards buying more loafers than sneakers and these totally fit the bill. If I have any problems with these I might update my review in the future but so far I love them.

"I often wear the white version of these socks, which are extremely well made, and these are those same socks but are colored.  The inside of these socks are fuzzy and consistent throughout, unlike cheaper socks that have lots of loose threads.

"What a good deal these shirts are! We were expecting lower quality for that price, but no! These shirts are awesome. My husband wears them to go golfing, they are lightweight, don’t get stinky even when soaked with rain & sweat (Florida). Quality is more than acceptable, no need to iron as they are mostly wrinkle free. Size is true to size. We’ve been washing them a lot already and they retained their color and elasticity. So definitely good washability and wearability overall! We are super pleased and have already ordered another set!",what a good deal these shirts are we were expecting lower quality for that price but no these shirts are awesome my husband wears them to go golfing they are lightweight don’t get stinky even when soaked with rain  sweat florida quality is more than acceptable no need to iron as they are mostly wrinkle free size is true to size we’ve been washing them a lot already and they retained their color and elasticity so definitely good washability and wearability overall we are super pleased and have already ordered another set,1
"This dress is cute for a flowy, non-fitted dress. There are faded stripes on the solid print colored dresses, and I was not prepared for that. But it gives the dress a sort of vintage feel with the puffed sleeves. The fabric is definitely thinner, but it doesn’t feel cheap and it’s very comfortable and light. It is a little see through. I’m 5’5”, 130lbs and I got a size small. An XS wasn’t available, or I think I would have liked to of sized down. Overall, I think I’m happy with this dress. It really just depends on how you prefer your dress to fit, loose or fitted.",this dress is cute for a flowy nonfitted dress there are faded stripes on the solid print colored dresses and i was not prepared for that but it gives the dress a sort of vintage feel with the puffed sleeves the fabric is definitely thinner but it doesn’t feel cheap and it’s very comfortable and light it is a little see through i’m ’” lbs and i got a size small an xs wasn’t available or i think i would have liked to of sized down overall i think i’m happy with this dress it really just depends on how you prefer your dress to fit loose or fitted,1

"These jeans are great. They are the one brand my husband likes the most because they last long and through a lot. They are a great fit and absolutely look great on him.

"I was pleasantly surprised by the materials of these Adidas shoes. Typically, shoes at this price point have lower-quality materials, but these exceeded my expectations. The materials feel sturdy and well-made, which is not always the case with more affordable options. The quality, style, and price are all very fair, making these shoes a great value. They offer a nice balance of durability and comfort while looking stylish.

"Received the shirt the next day. Initial observation is that this is a good shirt at a great price. The weave is not a true Oxford, but that is fine with me. It is light weight and hangs well. It has a generous collar height which I like because it drapes well across the shoulders and always appears crisp.I have not washed it yet so I cannot comment on shrinkage, if an. I will be buying more in different colors. For the price, you can't go wrong..Just received my second and third shirts (Black and a Blue pin stripe). Word of caution: These are sized to fit. If you want a little wiggle room you would be wise to order one size up.Update. One of the shirts lost a collar button during the first wash. Problem is that, unlike most manufacturers, this company does not provide a spare button attached to the shirt.

Quality pants. Fabric is slightly heavy. I'm 5'7 190 lbs. The tan pants I purchased hit me just at the ankle at the top of my shoe. They were not long as stated in other reviews. I purchased XL and they fit true to size. Snug on me but I prefer that to a baggy fit. Washed well and slightly shrunk but not significantly. The pockets do not lay flat but might if they are ironed.

I hate shorts that go below my knees and these fit perfectly just above the knee. Overall fit is comfortable. Normally I wear a size 40 in shorts/pants. Some 40’s don’t fit and some are perfect.

"For sizing : my husband has a hardy body type to buy for. He’s not fat but definitely stocky with muscular arms. His back and shoulders are broad and arms are thick but his waist isn’t huge, not small , just average. I bought the 2xl and thought it was huge when I first unpackaged it but once he tried it on, his shoulder fit was good and maybe even had a little extra moving room. His arms had room and didn’t look like they were going to bust at the seams. The torso was on the looser side but not horrible like he was swimming in it. I think the 1xl might be a better fit overall as I don’t think this material will shrink but he likes it as is. I think generally this will be nice vacation wear.",for sizing  my husband has a hardy body type to buy for he’s not fat but definitely stocky with muscular arms his back and shoulders are broad and arms are thick but his waist isn’t huge not small  just average i bought the xl and thought it was huge when i first unpackaged it but once he tried it on his shoulder fit was good and maybe even had a little extra moving room his arms had room and didn’t look like they were going to bust at the seams the torso was on the looser side but not horrible like he was swimming in it i think the xl might be a better fit overall as i don’t think this material will shrink but he likes it as is i think generally this will be nice vacation wear,1

"I waited almost a year to post this review to see if my initial conclusion was correct.  Essentially it was.  The bottom line is the Polo Ralph Lauren French Rib pants fit and feel the best of any pants.  Unfortunately, they’re expensive and not available on Amazon.  However, there are some pairs available on auction sites for reasonable prices. The next best is between the U.S. Polo Assn. Men's Fleece Cargo Pant and the Champion Men's Champion Eco Open Bottom Pant.  The problem with the U.S. Polo Assn. Men's Fleece Cargo is that they pill a lot and because they’re made of nylon they don’t breathe well if at all.  The problem with the Champion is they’re a bit long, a bit baggy and the waist is a bit big.  The rest of them aren’t even worth trying.  I’m looking forward to some affordable, high quality, great fitting sweat pants.  Unfortunately, they don’t exist at the moment.  Interesting note, I initially bought all the pants in size large, but they all seemed to fit a bit too tight not only in the waist but throughout the whole let as well.  I like my sweatpants loose fitting so I reordered them all in XL and made my conclusions based on that.Polo Ralph Lauren French RibThey are 100% cotton, which is extremely hard to find.  They may be the heaviest of all the pants (not necessarily good or bad), the most naturally soft (cotton soft compared to nylon “fleece” soft), and the best fit (loose, but not too loose, definitely not tight) throughout the waist and legs, and a good length (long enough that you may walk on the back of them when you’re not wearing shoes).  The inseam is very low however.  That is the one thing I would change.  I’d raise the inseam up by 2 inches.U.S. Polo Assn.

Nice fitting pants, but they’re 100% nylon “fleece” which have pilled horribly over a year and static cling often.

"I ordered a small and it's a bit small. I measured it and it's about 13 across the waistband. Maybe it'll stretch a bit after wearing it, but it's not like I can't use it (5' 8 and about 145lbs). I do think a lot of the reviews who say it is true to size are women. If you think about it that way, it kind of makes sense for the initial sizing, but might normalize after using them a bit. Or maybe it's just my batch? I like how stretchy they are, but they are a bit thinner than what I am use to.

"I've been using the Jerzees Men's Dri-Power Cotton Blend Long Sleeve Tees for quite some time now, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase! These shirts are incredibly comfortable, thanks to the soft cotton blend that feels great against the skin. The moisture-wicking feature is a game changer; it keeps me dry even during my most active days!One of the standout qualities of these tees is the odor protection. I often wear them for workouts and outdoor activities, and I’ve noticed that they truly do help prevent unwanted odors. Plus, with UPF 30+ protection, I feel confident wearing them in the sun without worrying about harmful rays.The fit is fantastic, with sizes ranging from S to 3X, ensuring there's something for everyone. I love the variety of colors available, making it easy to mix and match with my wardrobe.Overall, I highly recommend the Jerzees Dri-Power Long Sleeve Tees for anyone looking for a versatile, high-quality shirt that combines style with performance.

"I’m really impressed with the G Gradual Men's Sweatpants with Zipper Pockets. They’ve quickly become my go-to for workouts, lounging, and even casual errands.First off, the fit is spot on—true to size and perfectly tapered without being too tight or restrictive. The lightweight material makes them super comfortable, especially for active days or warmer weather, but they still feel sturdy and well-constructed.One of the standout features is the zipper pockets. They’re deep enough to hold essentials like my phone or wallet securely, so I don’t have to worry about anything falling out during a jog or when I’m on the go. It’s a small detail that makes a big difference, especially for athletic wear.Overall, these pants strike a great balance between comfort, style, and functionality. If you’re looking for athletic joggers with a modern fit and practical design, I’d highly recommend giving these a try!",i’m really impressed with the g gradual mens sweatpants with zipper pockets they’ve quickly become my goto for workouts lounging and even casual errandsfirst off the fit is spot on—true to size and perfectly tapered without being too tight or restrictive the lightweight material makes them super comfortable especially for active days or warmer weather but they still feel sturdy and wellconstructedone of the standout features is the zipper pockets they’re deep enough to hold essentials like my phone or wallet securely so i don’t have to worry about anything falling out during a jog or when i’m on the go it’s a small detail that makes a big difference especially for athletic wearoverall these pants strike a great balance between comfort style and functionality if you’re looking for athletic joggers with a modern fit and practical design i’d highly recommend giving these a try,1
"These are really good. I have had them since April of 2023 and let me tell you they have been used 5 days a week for most of that said life. I have worked a lot in food service including fast food and have had to use a lot of different crappy shoes that always are uncomfortable and leaving much to be desired. These while they did wear out on the back of the heel after heavy use about a year in, but didn't make them bad to wear. Believe it or not despite how much these shoes are worn on the top and the inside the bottom of the shoe was the part to finally give out and it now has a hole in the sole after all this time. They're expensive and it makes you want to go grab a shoes for crew thinking this time they will be better, just buy these and call it a day. These are a lot easier to clean then other sketchers that I have got. Never slipped or had any problems. Now I have to buy another pair and see if they get better. Maybe I'll leave another review 2ish years from when I get them. Why they didn't get 5 is because the stupid string to tighten them never worked right and always loosened.",these are really good i have had them since april of  and let me tell you they have been used  days a week for most of that said life i have worked a lot in food service including fast food and have had to use a lot of different crappy shoes that always are uncomfortable and leaving much to be desired these while they did wear out on the back of the heel after heavy use about a year in but didnt make them bad to wear believe it or not despite how much these shoes are worn on the top and the inside the bottom of the shoe was the part to finally give out and it now has a hole in the sole after all this time theyre expensive and it makes you want to go grab a shoes for crew thinking this time they will be better just buy these and call it a day these are a lot easier to clean then other sketchers that i have got never slipped or had any problems now i have to buy another pair and see if they get better maybe ill leave another review ish years from when i get them why they didnt get  is because the stupid string to tighten them never worked right and always loosened,1

"Big fan of the shorts. High quality material and fits well. I’ve always been hesitant of shorts with compression lining built in, mainly because other brands I’ve tried the compression wouldn’t hold its form as well or would ride up too much. These still ride up some but it’s mostly from movements when working out that would cause everything else to do the same. Really happy with these and have bought several pairs.

I did not think these would be all that comfortable seeing how long and pointy these are. The fit was a bit snug getting into but then I was also wearing gym socks. But even then it was able to fit and be quite comfortable. I wear a 13W so that is saying g something. I love that these are real leather which is why I chose them with proper care they will last longer then pleather. The soles appear to be quite good as well a softer rubber but not b-ball shoe soft.

"Great for working in a warehouse. Very protective. I can kick heavy stuff without hurting my foot if I curl my toes slightly. I've used my shoes to avoid pinching my fingers when setting down heavy objects, to get pallet jacks unstuck from pallets by holding the pallet in place with my foot, and to get old rusty latches on delivery vans open by kicking the lever. I know from experience that the steel toe can support over 1,000lbs, just don't tell my boss how I figured that out....I'm not sure how protective they are when it comes to stepping on nails, but I'll let update my review if I find out! (Stepping on nails sticking up out of boards isn't exactly a rare occurrence in warehouse and construction environments)They're surprisingly water resistant. Stepping in puddles, walking through snow, and even pressure-washing vehicles doesn't get my feet wet. They're quite grippy, and the tread on the soles doesn't seem to wear down. While wearing these, I've only ever slipped on ice and soapy concrete, never on wet wood, concrete floor, metal, etc.They're certainly not comfort shoes, but they're comfortable enough for work. Better than broken toes! They're not light, but they don't feel particularly heavy. I'm still fairly agile while wearing them, they're not great for running, but I can run in them comfortably and without tripping. It's quite comfortable to rest one foot on top of the other while sitting, since the shoes don't bend too easily like sneakers do.They're very durable, aside from the memory foam insoles, which develop holes pretty quickly, although you really can't feel the holes. In my experience, they last about 8 months, which is decent, considering they're relatively inexpensive and stand up to a lot. My first pair had a bit of peeling rubber on the front and the holes in the insoles had gotten quite deep, so I replaced them, although they're still wearable as a backup option. I just bought replacements for my second pair, which are actually in pretty good shape other than the inside of the left shoe wearing down, causing the hard protective layer inside to rub on my heel and cause minor discomfort while walking.The sizing seems accurate. I have fairly wide feet, and wear size 13 in most brands, sometimes 14 (eg, Under Armour). The size 13-Wide fits perfectly, with just enough room for my toes to not be squished together like they are in most shoes.9/10, would recommend these for anyone with the risk of injuring their feet at work.",great for working in a warehouse very protective i can kick heavy stuff without hurting my foot if i curl my toes slightly ive used my shoes to avoid pinching my fingers when setting down heavy objects to get pallet jacks unstuck from pallets by holding the pallet in place with my foot and to get old rusty latches on delivery vans open by kicking the lever i know from experience that the steel toe can support over lbs just dont tell my boss how i figured that outim not sure how protective they are when it comes to stepping on nails but ill let update my review if i find out stepping on nails sticking up out of boards isnt exactly a rare occurrence in warehouse and construction environmentstheyre surprisingly water resistant stepping in puddles walking through snow and even pressurewashing vehicles doesnt get my feet wet theyre quite grippy and the tread on the soles doesnt seem to wear down while wearing these ive only ever slipped on ice and soapy concrete never on wet wood concrete floor metal etctheyre certainly not comfort shoes but theyre comfortable enough for work better than broken toes theyre not light but they dont feel particularly heavy im still fairly agile while wearing them theyre not great for running but i can run in them comfortably and without tripping its quite comfortable to rest one foot on top of the other while sitting since the shoes dont bend too easily like sneakers dotheyre very durable aside from the memory foam insoles which develop holes pretty quickly although you really cant feel the holes in my experience they last about  months which is decent considering theyre relatively inexpensive and stand up to a lot my first pair had a bit of peeling rubber on the front and the holes in the insoles had gotten quite deep so i replaced them although theyre still wearable as a backup option i just bought replacements for my second pair which are actually in pretty good shape other than the inside of the left shoe wearing down causing the hard protective layer inside to rub on my heel and cause minor discomfort while walkingthe sizing seems accurate i have fairly wide feet and wear size  in most brands sometimes  eg under armour the size wide fits perfectly with just enough room for my toes to not be squished together like they are in most shoes would recommend these for anyone with the risk of injuring their feet at work,1

"Wrangler jeans are highly underrated.  These jeans are just as good, if not better than Levis Signature jeans for the cost.  Nice selection of colors and they fit as well as Levis.  Slim fit is the perfect style... not too baggy like relaxed and regular fit..... and not too dorky like skinny jeans.  Good for late spring through early fall in my area of the country.  Too thin for temps below 40 degrees in the winter,  in my opinion.  Wranglers wash and dry good in laundry cycles and keep their form and quality.

I had other slip resistant shoes from a previous job however they weren't waterproof.  I currently work in a restaurant and am on my feet for multiple hours a day and needed something that I feel comfortable in and these did the trick.  The slip on design also makes it easy to get on when I leave to go to work and throughout the day since I don't have to worry about laces coming undone and becoming a trip hazard.  They are also very comfortable which is a big plus because like I said I'm on my feet for multiple hours sometimes up to 13 hours.  I also trust the brand name that is Skechers.

"The new slip-in technology is the best thing ever for big people like me.  No more bending over to put on the shoes.  It is amazing.  I want to replace all my shoes with this style.  No more crushing your thumb to slip into a loafer.  No more exerting yourself to bend over to put on the shoes.  I raved about this so much that my wife bought a slip-in and loves it also.Also, this version with the arch support and gogamat is far superior then memory foam for cushion for big men, because memory foam crushes down and does not cushion for obese people.  The gogamat does provide longer lasting cushion comfort for longer periods of time.Also, Sketchers has a bunch of slip-in shoes that have very spongee type soles.  I don't recommend those for obese people as there is less support and stability.  I have weak ankles due to a lifetime of obesity and ankle sprains.  The firmer soles on this shoe, and the Goodyear rubber, make for a much more stable and long-lasting shoe.This is a good looking shoe that can be worn casually with dockers or jeans.  And my work is very casual office work, so these look great at work.  I plan on buying more like these, in a dressier version to ware to trade shows, and maybe a gogamat version in an athletic shoe if I can find a version with good sole stability.",the new slipin technology is the best thing ever for big people like me  no more bending over to put on the shoes  it is amazing  i want to replace all my shoes with this style  no more crushing your thumb to slip into a loafer  no more exerting yourself to bend over to put on the shoes  i raved about this so much that my wife bought a slipin and loves it alsoalso this version with the arch support and gogamat is far superior then memory foam for cushion for big men because memory foam crushes down and does not cushion for obese people  the gogamat does provide longer lasting cushion comfort for longer periods of timealso sketchers has a bunch of slipin shoes that have very spongee type soles  i dont recommend those for obese people as there is less support and stability  i have weak ankles due to a lifetime of obesity and ankle sprains  the firmer soles on this shoe and the goodyear rubber make for a much more stable and longlasting shoethis is a good looking shoe that can be worn casually with dockers or jeans  and my work is very casual office work so these look great at work  i plan on buying more like these in a dressier version to ware to trade shows and maybe a gogamat version in an athletic shoe if i can find a version with good sole stability,1

"Interesting sleeves on this T-shirt. I went with the Color: C Blue in Size: XX-Large. For reference I'm over 50 years old. Height 5'6, weight 170lbs measurements Bust: 43 Waist: 34 Hips: 43. I could have gone with the XLarge, but wanted extra room to make adjustments for fit.The fabric on this shirt is lightweight, stretchy on the horizontal and fairly soft. On my softness scale of 1-5, I would give it a 4.25. It has not bothered my sensitive skin. It has been through the washer and dryer, left in the dryer overnight, then folded up for a few days before I got to this review. I can say it holds no wrinkles so would work for traveling. It did not shrink or bleed color in the laundering, nor did it pick up excess lint. There is a tiny bit of twisting, but not sure it's even enough that would be noticed. My only real issue is the stitching on the pleating was not always tied off or back stitched. Some were, some not. Kind of odd that. At least they are long enough to not look like a maternity shirt. The small V on the neckline does not lay flat, but I don't find that to be an issue. Otherwise the construction seems fine, basic and done on a serger.Overall fairly happy with it and feel it's worth taking the time to make adjustments for fit.PeaceI generally get things oversized for comfort but also in-case I need to do any sewing adjustments.

"This shirt has been an excellent addition to my wardrobe, especially for active and outdoor activities. The quick-drying fabric is a standout feature, keeping me comfortable and dry even on hot days. It's perfect for golf, casual outings, or just running errands in warm weather. The shirt also offers 40+ UPF protection, which is a great bonus for those sunny days, giving me peace of mind knowing I'm protected from harmful UV rays.One thing I really appreciate is the comfort of this polo. The fabric is soft and breathable, and it moves well with my body without feeling restrictive. The fit is just right, not too tight and not too loose, providing a flattering look without compromising on comfort. While the shirt performs exceptionally well, I did notice that it tends to wrinkle a bit after washing, so it requires a quick iron to look its best. However, this is a minor inconvenience given all the other benefits it offers.I think this shirt is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a comfortable, practical, and protective polo for active wear. It has become a go-to in my wardrobe, and I highly recommend it for its performance and comfort.",this shirt has been an excellent addition to my wardrobe especially for active and outdoor activities the quickdrying fabric is a standout feature keeping me comfortable and dry even on hot days its perfect for golf casual outings or just running errands in warm weather the shirt also offers  upf protection which is a great bonus for those sunny days giving me peace of mind knowing im protected from harmful uv raysone thing i really appreciate is the comfort of this polo the fabric is soft and breathable and it moves well with my body without feeling restrictive the fit is just right not too tight and not too loose providing a flattering look without compromising on comfort while the shirt performs exceptionally well i did notice that it tends to wrinkle a bit after washing so it requires a quick iron to look its best however this is a minor inconvenience given all the other benefits it offersi think this shirt is a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a comfortable practical and protective polo for active wear it has become a goto in my wardrobe and i highly recommend it for its performance and comfort,1

"1st of all. I'm short and fluffy. My feet are wide. I walk on concrete all day. I'm exposed to the elements all the time. I have been told by my doctor to wear breathable shoes (mesh) which I do but they make my feet look long and big. I have tried wide toe shoes. (In a size 10) but they still hurt my feet. Most shoes I seem to slide forward and my toes hurt like crazy at the end of the day. I got these shoes in a 10.5 and I can walk all day in them. Good grip on the bottom and my feet stay dry. When I first got the shoes I loosened the laces and they were a little snug. I thought I wasted money yet again. But then I stood up and began walking in them and then relief came. I'm super pleased they had half sizes. It truly made a difference.  I walk more now they are so comfortable. I wish more shoes came in half sizes, I will buy more. I just need this shoe now in a gray color and I'll be set. At my age it's all about comfort not cuteness. I hope they work as good for you as they do for me, by the way I never leave reviews.

"I recently purchased the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. Gold Men's Relaxed Fit Flex Jeans for my husband, and they have quickly become his favorite pair of jeans. These jeans offer a perfect blend of comfort, style, and durability, making them ideal for everyday wear.First and foremost, the comfort of these jeans is exceptional. The relaxed fit provides ample room through the seat and thigh, ensuring unrestricted movement and all-day comfort. The inclusion of Flex denim technology adds an extra layer of comfort, allowing the jeans to stretch and move with him without feeling restrictive. This feature is particularly appreciated during activities that require a lot of bending and stretching.The quality of the denim is impressive. Made from a blend of cotton and elastane, the fabric feels sturdy yet soft against the skin. The denim is thick enough to be durable and long-lasting, yet it doesn't feel heavy or uncomfortable. The stitching and construction are solid, indicating that these jeans are built to withstand regular wear and washing.The style of the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. Gold Men's Relaxed Fit Flex Jeans is versatile and timeless. The relaxed fit offers a classic look that pairs well with a variety of tops, from casual t-shirts to dressier button-down shirts. The jeans come in a range of washes, allowing you to choose the one that best suits your style. My husband particularly likes the dark wash for its ability to transition seamlessly from day to night.One of the standout features of these jeans is their practical design. The traditional five-pocket styling provides plenty of storage for essentials like keys, wallet, and phone. The pockets are deep and functional, which is a big plus for everyday use. The waistband sits comfortably at the waist, and the belt loops are sturdy enough to accommodate a variety of belts.Another advantage of these jeans is their ease of maintenance. They are machine washable and retain their shape and color well even after multiple washes. This durability ensures that they remain a reliable part of my husband's wardrobe for a long time.In terms of fit, the jeans run true to size. My husband found his usual size to be a perfect fit, providing the relaxed feel he was looking for without being too loose. The addition of Flex denim technology means that the jeans adapt well to different body shapes, providing a comfortable fit for various body types.In summary, the Signature by Levi Strauss & Co. Gold Men's Relaxed Fit Flex Jeans are an excellent choice for anyone seeking comfortable, stylish, and durable jeans.

"Perfect for our company Bollywood night! I watched some YouTube videos on how to wrap the saree and even though my technique wasn’t the greatest since it was my first time, I received so many compliments! It pleated well enough. I was glad for the extra material for the top which I did not use because it gave me a better drape off my shoulder. I purchased another top on Amazon to wear under my saree. I was going to give it 4 stars because there was a sizable chunk of frayed material that I had to trim off. Once I wore it, it wasn’t noticeable but it was still damage so I was going to take one star off. It’s beautiful and the shipping was on time, fast one day shipping so I went ahead and gave it 5 stars despite the damage section because it was on the edge of the material and once I cut off the frayed threads it wasn’t noticeable.

"When the pants arrived the top was folded in an unusual way. The reason became clear immediately - the button was far too large for the button hole (or the hole was made too small - your choice).  I do not expect to have to modify new trousers before I can wear them. Other than that they fit well - I ordered the large based on the size chart (I usually wear 32 X 32 pants). The length was just right since yoga pants are usually somewhat shorter than regular trousers.However, the slant pockets on the sides are sewn on the outside of the leg, so they stick out like elephant ears. Hoping that this was just the result of the odd folding, I washed the pants in cold water and dried them at normal temperature. Because they are mostly polyester (67% Polyester,20% Linen, 12% Viscose,1% Cotton), I assumed they would handle that routine at least as well as higher percentage cotton pants do. Unfortunately I was wrong - they shrunk so badly that they are a bit tight at the waist and far too short to wear anywhere other than the beach. And the side pockets still stick out.",when the pants arrived the top was folded in an unusual way the reason became clear immediately  the button was far too large for the button hole or the hole was made too small  your choice  i do not expect to have to modify new trousers before i can wear them other than that they fit well  i ordered the large based on the size chart i usually wear  x  pants the length was just right since yoga pants are usually somewhat shorter than regular trousershowever the slant pockets on the sides are sewn on the outside of the leg so they stick out like elephant ears hoping that this was just the result of the odd folding i washed the pants in cold water and dried them at normal temperature because they are mostly polyester  polyester linen  viscose cotton i assumed they would handle that routine at least as well as higher percentage cotton pants do unfortunately i was wrong  they shrunk so badly that they are a bit tight at the waist and far too short to wear anywhere other than the beach and the side pockets still stick out,0

Finally found some shoes that have helped my plantar fasciitis. I’ve been searching everywhere for some shoes to help relieve bad foot pain. These shoes are awesome. There’s only a few negative things I have to say which is the reason i rated 4 instead of 5. First it runs small. I usually wear a 9.5 but these are really tight. I think a full size up would’ve been more better. Second it’s hard to get used to walking in these in the beginning. They’re really bouncy which I like since it mostly absorbs the hard ground protecting your feet. Great shoes overall.

"When it comes to summer, there are a few must-haves: sunscreen, a cold drink, and a pair of shorts that can handle any activity. Enter the Volcom Men's Vmonty Stretch Chino Short - the ultimate summer short.First off, these shorts are stretchy. Not like I just ate a big meal stretchy, but I can do a cartwheel and not rip my pants stretchy. So whether you're lounging on the beach or playing a game of pickup basketball, these shorts have got your back (and your legs).But it's not just about the stretch. These shorts also have all the features you need for a day in the sun. They have pockets (duh), a zipper fly (double duh), and a stylish design that says I'm casual, but I still care about my appearance.Of course, like any product, there are some downsides. For one, the sizing can be a bit tricky, so make sure you double-check the size chart before ordering. And while the stretchiness is great, it does mean that the shorts can sometimes ride up a bit when you're moving around a lot.Overall, though, these shorts are a summer must-have. They're comfortable, versatile, and look great. So whether you're hitting the beach or just lounging in your backyard, the Volcom Men's Vmonty Stretch Chino Short has got you covered (literally).",when it comes to summer there are a few musthaves sunscreen a cold drink and a pair of shorts that can handle any activity enter the volcom mens vmonty stretch chino short  the ultimate summer shortfirst off these shorts are stretchy not like i just ate a big meal stretchy but i can do a cartwheel and not rip my pants stretchy so whether youre lounging on the beach or playing a game of pickup basketball these shorts have got your back and your legsbut its not just about the stretch these shorts also have all the features you need for a day in the sun they have pockets duh a zipper fly double duh and a stylish design that says im casual but i still care about my appearanceof course like any product there are some downsides for one the sizing can be a bit tricky so make sure you doublecheck the size chart before ordering and while the stretchiness is great it does mean that the shorts can sometimes ride up a bit when youre moving around a lotoverall though these shorts are a summer musthave theyre comfortable versatile and look great so whether youre hitting the beach or just lounging in your backyard the volcom mens vmonty stretch chino short has got you covered literally,1

"I don't like elastic bands that have to stretch too much and then put too much pressure on my waist and leave a mark when I remove the underwear later.  I got the 2X Large size, which was one size larger than suggested for my actual waist size, and it just put the minimum pressure needed to keep them in place, yet leaves no mark after wearing them for hours.  The material is very breathable and after a minute or so you won't even be aware you are wearing them.  Very comfortable.  There was another major brand I tried, but aside from being too tight in the waist, there was some chemical in their elastic waist bands that triggered an allergic reaction and left a itchy rash all around my waist!  As soon as I saw that, they went right in the garbage!One slight problem I encountered, though, with these Fruit of the Loom Boxer briefs.  My 3 pack contained two black and one gray standard length pair and I noticed that they had a bit of a chemical smell to them right out of their pack.  I washed them each by hand twice in hot soapy water followed by rinses in hot fresh water.  I noticed that when wringing out the two black pairs, they initially released a lot of dark dye into the water.  These repeated washing have almost completely removed the chemical odor and they don't seem to be losing as much dye now.  The smell and the dye loss will probably be gone with another few washings.Most importantly, these briefs fit somewhat loosely especially where they surround the thighs.  The pouch gives one's equipment just the right amount of room.  They are very cool and comfortable.  There's no button down fly on them.  Instead they just use the overlapped panel approach which is fine.I can recommend these Fruit of the Loom men's briefs.  But, for maximum comfort, I recommend getting the next larger size than that listed for you actual waist size.  That will assure that the waist band will not leave a mark on your skin after wearing them for hours.  I also recommend hand washing them several times before wearing them for the first time just to make sure you don't absorb any loose dye molecules into your skin and body.",i dont like elastic bands that have to stretch too much and then put too much pressure on my waist and leave a mark when i remove the underwear later  i got the x large size which was one size larger than suggested for my actual waist size and it just put the minimum pressure needed to keep them in place yet leaves no mark after wearing them for hours  the material is very breathable and after a minute or so you wont even be aware you are wearing them  very comfortable  there was another major brand i tried but aside from being too tight in the waist there was some chemical in their elastic waist bands that triggered an allergic reaction and left a itchy rash all around my waist  as soon as i saw that they went right in the garbageone slight problem i encountered though with these fruit of the loom boxer briefs  my  pack contained two black and one gray standard length pair and i noticed that they had a bit of a chemical smell to them right out of their pack  i washed them each by hand twice in hot soapy water followed by rinses in hot fresh water  i noticed that when wringing out the two black pairs they initially released a lot of dark dye into the water  these repeated washing have almost completely removed the chemical odor and they dont seem to be losing as much dye now  the smell and the dye loss will probably be gone with another few washingsmost importantly these briefs fit somewhat loosely especially where they surround the thighs  the pouch gives ones equipment just the right amount of room  they are very cool and comfortable  theres no button down fly on them  instead they just use the overlapped panel approach which is finei can recommend these fruit of the loom mens briefs  but for maximum comfort i recommend getting the next larger size than that listed for you actual waist size  that will assure that the waist band will not leave a mark on your skin after wearing them for hours  i also recommend hand washing them several times before wearing them for the first time just to make sure you dont absorb any loose dye molecules into your skin and body,1

Any size bigger and the arms would would fit bad and be too long at the waist area.The scark is attached to the jacket via elastic loops and buttons on the scarf itself so it stays in place and flat.The material is relatively thick and weighty and nicely lined on the inside using two kinds of fabric. One for chest add another for the inner sleeves.The front flat pockets are cosmetic but it does have side pockets. No inner pockets.Honestly a solid purchase for the look, materials and fit.

These have the ‚Äúaesthetic‚Äù of if the paces are short tuck them in. I had to adjust the laces so my foot was comfy (a bit tighter), and now they are longer, but still too short to tie.

"I purchased various Legendary Whitetails Men's Journeyman Shirt Jackets as Christmas gifts for my husband, my two sons, and my two nephews. The gifts were well received. They were a big hit at our family Christmas party. The only complaint I overheard came from the boys wanting more of them.This particular shirt/jacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt. I mentioned that I ordered several different colors and styles of this brand. Fortunately, the son who attends college in Boulder ended up with this one. All of the other Legendary Whitetails Shirt/Jackets I ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirt/jacket. This worked out well for us because we live in Louisiana, my other son is in Pharmacy school in the deep south, and my two nephews live in Texas.This Shirt/Jacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather. It's not clothing you would want to keep on while inside.Regarding sizing, my son said it is true to size. He is a true Medium in nearly everything I purchase. He's 20 years old, 5'10 or maybe 5'll, and about 160 pounds. He works out and is fit, but has broad shoulders. I bought a size Medium for my husband as well. He is 170, 5'10. My other son is about the same height and weight.They can easily wear a shirt, sweatshirt, hoodie, or turtleneck beneath the shirt/jacket. I suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area. If you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirt/jacket, you may want to consider the bigger size.This shirt/jacket is a remarkable deal for the price. Everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times. The jackets look better now -- with that worn-in look. It keeps the bitter cold of Michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind. The shirt/Jacket has several interior and exterior pockets.I can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family Christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for 2022.If you're looking for a heavier shirt/jacket for colder months, one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie, this is for you. If you are looking for a lighter-weight shirt/jacket that you can leave on indoors then I would try one of Legendary Whitetails many other shirt/jacket options.Overall, this is a fabulous product. It outperforms competitors in value, purpose, and appearance. That’s a winner in my opinion",i purchased various legendary whitetails mens journeyman shirt jackets as christmas gifts for my husband my two sons and my two nephews the gifts were well received they were a big hit at our family christmas party the only complaint i overheard came from the boys wanting more of themthis particular shirtjacket is definitely more of a jacket than a shirt i mentioned that i ordered several different colors and styles of this brand fortunately the son who attends college in boulder ended up with this one all of the other legendary whitetails shirtjackets i ordered were more on the shirt side of a shirtjacket this worked out well for us because we live in louisiana my other son is in pharmacy school in the deep south and my two nephews live in texasthis shirtjacket is exceptionally comfortable and is good for colder weather its not clothing you would want to keep on while insideregarding sizing my son said it is true to size he is a true medium in nearly everything i purchase hes  years old  or maybe ll and about  pounds he works out and is fit but has broad shoulders i bought a size medium for my husband as well he is   my other son is about the same height and weightthey can easily wear a shirt sweatshirt hoodie or turtleneck beneath the shirtjacket i suggest ordering your normal size unless you like your jackets to fit baggy or you are larger in the stomach area if you live in the north or midwest and plan on layering more than one article of clothing under the shirtjacket you may want to consider the bigger sizethis shirtjacket is a remarkable deal for the price everyone who received one as a gift from me has worn theirs multiple times the jackets look better now  with that wornin look it keeps the bitter cold of michigan from biting and protects from harsh wind the shirtjacket has several interior and exterior pocketsi can tell when someone genuinely likes a gift and this topped our family christmas bestseller list and has already been added to the repeat performer list for if youre looking for a heavier shirtjacket for colder months one that you can layer or wear over a sweatshirt or hoodie this is for you if you are looking for a lighterweight shirtjacket that you can leave on indoors then i would try one of legendary whitetails many other shirtjacket optionsoverall this is a fabulous product it outperforms competitors in value purpose and appearance that’s a winner in my opinion,1

In fact, the fabric around the underwear area is kind of small-ish and barely covers the rump. (Think low-rise jeans, as opposed to high-waisted jeans.)  The arms, on the other hand, even after washing, are overly long. We had to fold them over a couple of times.  The camo color is really excellent, and they are comfortable enough.  The kid loves them.  Don't know why they are called fleece lined. They aren't.  They are the same long john material as 32 Degree kids base layer.

This coat arrived today. I was concerned about the size and the chart provided just didn't make any sense to me.  I normally wear a large so I wound up buying a large although the chart said I needed an extra large.  When I looked at the label inside coat the tag shows L for US and L for EU and XL for JP and XXL for CN.  So that solved the mystery. The coat is very well made and I like the snaps. The fleece lining is nice but not really fleece.  Didn't expect real fleece for this price but I do like the price.xx,this coat arrived today i was concerned about the size and the chart provided just didnt make any sense to me  i normally wear a large so i wound up buying a large although the chart said i needed an extra large  when i looked at the label inside coat the tag shows l for us and l for eu and xl for jp and xxl for cn  so that solved the mystery the coat is very well made and i like the snaps the fleece lining is nice but not really fleece  didnt expect real fleece for this price but i do like the pricexx,1

"I am often hesitant to buy shoes online, especially on a product that allows you to step in hands free.  I was pleasantly surprised to find that these shoes not only fit well, they lived up to their description of being hands free.  The heel is a little higher than most traditional lace up shoes, but not uncomfortably so.  It is sturdy and supportive, and for me, that adds to the secure fit while walking.  Like all Skechers shoes, the insole is extremely cushiony and a pleasure to wear all day.  I reduced the rating by one star simply for the color offerings in this line, but of course that is a personal thing.

"I've become a big fan of these jeans. I've always had Levis, but decided to try these 18 months ago to see how the classic Wrangler jeans looked with my cowboy boots. At that point I had about a dozen pairs of Levis - now, I'm down to two pairs of Levis and eleven pairs of these Wrangler 936 slim fit jeans. That's how much I like them!There's a lot of reviews here saying these jeans are tight, and they are (they're meant to be), but I think some reviewers are perhaps being a little optimistic with their sizing. I wear a 30"" waist in Levis and have found that these Wranglers fit me snugly in a 31"" waist size, and very snugly with a 30"" waist size, but are still not at all uncomfortable. In fact I have both sizes, depending on the look I'm going for - the 31s fit perfectly through the hips and seat, snug but not tight. The 30s however fit me nice and tight in the same areas, as well as being much tighter through the thighs. Both are comfortable but I can feel the 30s pulling everything in as I zip them up, which should give an idea of how they fit. There is certainly no room for bulky underwear and perhaps that's the mistake some people are making with their designer boxers - I'm not an underwear fashion victim however and my ""tighty whitey"" briefs work absolutely fine with these jeans. The legs are quite trim but go perfectly over the tops of my cowboy boots, I never tuck them into my boots but they are skinny enough to do so if that's your look. The waist is fairly high and looks good with a tucked-in T-shirt and nice belt - I do think those who have a bit of a belly might feel this makes them feel too tight also, but being in my twenties and still managing to hold onto my flat stomach I can't really comment. I may change my mind in a couple of decades, but as it stands, I would agree with a previous reviewer's slightly blunt suggestion that these are really cut to provide a tight fit for boys rather than larger men - so whilst they fit my small frame very nicely, bigger guys looking for a comfier fit would be better off with the 13MWZ version.Quality and detail is nice, perhaps some of the stitching doesn't appear to be on a par with Levis (especially round the crotch) but I've yet to have a pair show any signs of failure. The various colours are nicely finished and (again, unlike some reviewers) I actually quite like the Wrangler patch on the back. Yes, it's plastic and not leather, but that kind-of goes with the simple and basic nature of these jeans. The seven belt loops even on the 30"" size is a plus, although not strictly necessary on my small waist I'm sure it helps on the larger sizes. The two front belt loops are a little closer together than I'd like with some of my chunkier belts but it doesn't look out of place and, again, a larger waist will probably not suffer this issue. Other details like the extra rivets and bold ""W""s on the pockets are distinctive. The material has a soft and tactile feel entirely missing from my recent Levis, although I should point out that the ""rigid"" indigo versions of these are made of a much stiffer material. Not unpleasant, just different. With eleven pairs, I have these in most of the available colours and my favourites are the Rough Stone and Charcoal Grey ones, although the bleach ones are a particularly cool colour too.In summary then, great jeans. I always used to find Wranglers a bit ""cheesy"" as a Levis-wearing kid, but now I wish I'd discovered these years ago.

"I have always had a hard time finding dresses that are comfortable, flattering, and also fashionable. This dress hits all of those (plus, it's also affordable!). I live in Tampa, FL, where it's hot and humid most of the year, so I love how the fabric is lightweight but not too thin. I like how the dress gives you a waistline without clinging to the belly area. I like the slightly longer sleeves (keeps me from getting too cold if I step into the A/C for a while!). I also really like that the wrap neckline is sexy but isn't too deep, making the dress appropriate for family settings.The only two possible gripes I have with this dress is that it falls a bit shorter on me than I personally prefer (about 3 above my knees), which makes it so I have to be mindful if it's windy. The second gripe is that the fabric and stitching feel a little bit cheap. But you get what you pay for!Overall, I am very happy with this dress, and I'm thinking about purchasing another! For reference, I bought a size large, I'm 5'8'', my weight is 170 lbs., and my bust/waist/hip measurements are 38, 33, and 43, respectively.",i have always had a hard time finding dresses that are comfortable flattering and also fashionable this dress hits all of those plus its also affordable i live in tampa fl where its hot and humid most of the year so i love how the fabric is lightweight but not too thin i like how the dress gives you a waistline without clinging to the belly area i like the slightly longer sleeves keeps me from getting too cold if i step into the ac for a while i also really like that the wrap neckline is sexy but isnt too deep making the dress appropriate for family settingsthe only two possible gripes i have with this dress is that it falls a bit shorter on me than i personally prefer about  above my knees which makes it so i have to be mindful if its windy the second gripe is that the fabric and stitching feel a little bit cheap but you get what you pay foroverall i am very happy with this dress and im thinking about purchasing another for reference i bought a size large im  my weight is  lbs and my bustwaisthip measurements are   and  respectively,1

"The shirts are really excellent.  I've been a Hanes T shirt wearer for most of my life, but  I needed some extra colored lightweight T shirts and went ahead and bought these, and I have to say they are really very nice T shirts.  High quality, light weight, extremely soft, and breathable T shirts. They arrived with each shirt individually wrapped,and for the price and quality I'm very happy with them.  The only disappointing thing was realizing they are made in China, which I didn't know beforehand. Nothing against Chinese people of course, but the Chinese Communist Party in charge there is evil and exploits and abuses their own people, so while these shirts are great, I feel some slight shame to know I'm enjoying a product that was likely made using slave labor, or at the very least exploited labor.  Amazon should put Chinese products as one of the filter out options. That being said, they're excellent quality in my humble opinion. Some of the comments on here have said that the neckhole is too wide, but I disagree.  Do you really want a tight collar on a t-shirt? I am posting a picture that I literally just took (I was already wearing one of the shirts,lol) and I really dont feel like the collar is too wide, however, I'm also not a fan of having a tight or close-fitting collar, so maybe that's why.

"I really like the way these Skechers Men's Cessnock Food Service Shoes look and they function nicely. These are definitely not slip-in types, you will need to keep ahold of the rear of the shoe to get it over the heel and Achilles or use a shoehorn but they are quite easy to put them on and they are very stable and secure feeling once they are on. They are slip resistant, like a lot of this brand are and I walk through several large kitchens during my rounds of a few buildings without having to worry a lot about an unexpected slip fall. I have worn several of Sketchers shoes and many of them are slip-on type. These shoes in particular run a lot more narrow than the others do. If I am moving around these shoes feel really good but if I am standing in place or seated for extended times they squeeze and cut off circulation a tad. I ordered these in the same size I normally would in a Sketchers Slip On. I don't think a larger size would fit as well lengthwise but if I ever order another pair of them I will try a size up just to get them wider.They look good and function well.",i really like the way these skechers mens cessnock food service shoes look and they function nicely these are definitely not slipin types you will need to keep ahold of the rear of the shoe to get it over the heel and achilles or use a shoehorn but they are quite easy to put them on and they are very stable and secure feeling once they are on they are slip resistant like a lot of this brand are and i walk through several large kitchens during my rounds of a few buildings without having to worry a lot about an unexpected slip fall i have worn several of sketchers shoes and many of them are slipon type these shoes in particular run a lot more narrow than the others do if i am moving around these shoes feel really good but if i am standing in place or seated for extended times they squeeze and cut off circulation a tad i ordered these in the same size i normally would in a sketchers slip on i dont think a larger size would fit as well lengthwise but if i ever order another pair of them i will try a size up just to get them widerthey look good and function well,1

"I'm impressed with these shirts, and I've been buying shirts for the office for 40+ years. To think that I can get a 100% cotton shirt for around $25 is remarkable. In the 1990s, I routinely paid $80 and higher for a dress shirt. These button-collared shirts are great for my current workplace. For cotton shirts, they come out of the washer/dryer with fewer wrinkles than my expensive dress shirts and need just a light ironing before wearing. Of course, they only come in small, medium and large, so the fit is pretty generic, especially around the neck. I wear a 15 1/2-inch collar with a 34-35 sleeve length & the Alimens Large is too roomy in the neck for me to wear a tie; fortunately, I don't wear a tie on most days at the office. But the sleeve length is good, the classic fit is comfortable, and I'm glad to have this option in my closet.

"This is a great jacket for the price.  Zipper is sturdy and cuffs are snug to keep out the wind.  Calling it heavyweight is fine -- but it's not as bulky and heavy as my 23-year old parka (which is still in decent shape), for example.  So, I'd say it provides a lot of warmth for its weight.The handwarmer pockets are big enough for a heavy glove, and the interior pocket has a velcro closure to secure your phone or wallet.The hood is well shaped: it lays down nicely when not in use, and you can mold around your head -- I don't miss having a draw-cord.  It seems pretty secure in the wind as long as you angle it properly.  The fleece lining keeps my head warm when I'm not wearing a knit cap.Fit: I'm 42 chest, and I bought a medium.  I still have room to wear a heavy sweatshirt or sweater under this coat.  I have to say that in temperatures from the mid-20s to high 30s, I don't really need a heavy layer underneath.  Wind resistance is very good.Just started trying Amazon Essentials clothing in the last 8 months, and have been quite satisfied, so far.

"I'm going nuts trying to find cotton socks lately, everything is polyester, cotton is like a premium fabric now. I never buy name brand socks but thought I'd try these because so many of the no-name socks are such garbage. These socks are EXCELLENT. They are very soft, and appear to be thick enough to last for a while.For the record , the most recent cotton crew socks I bought on here were the UnderArmour cotton crews. They were OK, but they did start to get holes in the sole within 6 months or so, which is quicker than I'd hoped (especially since I rotate my socks, only wear the same pair maybe 2x per month?) Anyway, these Polo socks are DEFINITELY softer and higher-quality cotton than the UAs, the elastic is tighter, and I believe they may be slightly thicker as well. Hopefully, they'll hold up better long-term too. But I'm very satisfied for now (it's been two or three wash cycles so far) and will probably order another set of these, since it's so hard to find good cotton socks.One interesting thing: the Polo logo only appears on one side of each 'tube'. (logo is knitted too, not printed, another quality feature) This may be a clever feature for longevity-- if you always wear the logo facing the 'outside' of your leg for example, then each sock will be permanently assigned to either the left foot or the right foot. Not sure if this makes any difference, but it occurs to me it may lessen the 'stretching' of the fabric over time in different directions, which may happen with double-logo socks (swapping each sock back & forth from left foot to right foot after each wash etc). Just a thought.",im going nuts trying to find cotton socks lately everything is polyester cotton is like a premium fabric now i never buy name brand socks but thought id try these because so many of the noname socks are such garbage these socks are excellent they are very soft and appear to be thick enough to last for a whilefor the record  the most recent cotton crew socks i bought on here were the underarmour cotton crews they were ok but they did start to get holes in the sole within  months or so which is quicker than id hoped especially since i rotate my socks only wear the same pair maybe x per month anyway these polo socks are definitely softer and higherquality cotton than the uas the elastic is tighter and i believe they may be slightly thicker as well hopefully theyll hold up better longterm too but im very satisfied for now its been two or three wash cycles so far and will probably order another set of these since its so hard to find good cotton socksone interesting thing the polo logo only appears on one side of each tube logo is knitted too not printed another quality feature this may be a clever feature for longevity if you always wear the logo facing the outside of your leg for example then each sock will be permanently assigned to either the left foot or the right foot not sure if this makes any difference but it occurs to me it may lessen the stretching of the fabric over time in different directions which may happen with doublelogo socks swapping each sock back  forth from left foot to right foot after each wash etc just a thought,1

They’re dainty, color is exactly as described, they’re high quality, they offer arch support without being ugly, they’re perfect for summertime! Wear them with jeans, shorts, dresses, they’re perfect. I love how comfortable they are to walk in. Soft but not squishy, really feels like they hold their shape. I have some other “mush” sandals by another company… they start out SUPER comfy, but they squish down to nothing after like 4 wears. Oh, one other thing I like about these. I have semi-wide feet and normally can’t wear women’s sandals like this, I always have to buy the men’s alternative, which always have the super wide strap (hence my tan line).

"LOVE these shoes and glad I got them. Was surprised how this iconic color isn't getting much sales cause I was expecting the 15 left or 10 left line with the count of stock. But overall, was GLAD it was in stock, and happy with this. Reason I gave it 4 stars was the comfort overall. It's good with the cloud foam but doesn't feel all like cloud foam.

"The Children's Place Boys Athletic Basketball shorts are a great choice, but be mindful of sizing.

"I recently purchased a pair of men's shorts from Amazon Essentials and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with the quality and design of these shorts. From casual outings to outdoor activities, these shorts have exceeded my expectations in terms of comfort and style.First and foremost, the material used is top-notch. The fabric is soft, lightweight, and breathable, making it perfect for hot summer days. I never felt sweaty or uncomfortable while wearing these shorts, even during long walks or outdoor sports activities. Additionally, the fabric is durable and has held up well after multiple washes, which is a testament to its high quality.The fit of these shorts is also worth mentioning. They have a relaxed fit that is neither too tight nor too loose, providing just the right amount of room for movement without looking baggy. I appreciate the attention to detail in the design, such as the deep pockets that are perfect for holding my phone, keys, and wallet securely.In terms of style, these shorts are versatile and can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion. Whether I'm running errands around town or meeting friends for a casual hangout, these shorts always look great. The classic design with subtle details gives them a timeless appeal that I know will never go out of style.Overall, I highly recommend these men's shorts from Amazon Essentials  to anyone looking for a comfortable and stylish option for their wardrobe.

"So glad I purchased this coat which was delivered so quickly. It arrived just in time for a real cold snap. I'm 76 years old and as many older people, I get cold easily. I live in the south where we are not used to very cold weather, at least not extended cold weather. Right after the coat arrived the night temps were in the teens with day time temps below freezing. We have two dogs that need to be walked separately early mornngs. So, I layered up, put on this coat, gloves and knit boggan and stayed warm for both walks. Maybe that doesn't impress you but I'm very impressed with this coat. It's well made and wind proof, to some degree anyway. Mine does not have a sleeve patch but does have the chest patch. I don't see the problem. Men wear t-shirts with advertisements on them all the time. It's not a big deal.

"I purchased the Lacoste Contemporary Collection's Men's Short Sleeve Pima Crewneck Tee Shirt and it has been an absolute delight to wear. The comfort it offers is unparalleled and it quickly became one of my go-to pieces for casual wear.First and foremost, the comfort this tee offers is truly exceptional. The Pima cotton material is soft and breathable, making it ideal for all-day wear. Whether I'm out and about or just lounging at home, this tee shirt has proven to be extremely comfortable.In addition to its comfort, the brand itself has always been a favorite of mine. Lacoste is known for their high-quality products and this tee shirt is no exception. The craftsmanship is evident in the sturdy stitching and the durability of the fabric. The Lacoste logo adds a touch of class and recognition to the tee, elevating it from a basic tee to a stylish wardrobe staple.However, while I'm extremely pleased with the quality and comfort of this Lacoste tee, I must express my discontent with the cost. The price point for this tee is quite high compared to other brands offering similar products. Though the quality and comfort are undoubtedly superior, the cost may deter potential buyers, as it did give me pause.In conclusion, the Lacoste Contemporary Collection's Men's Short Sleeve Pima Crewneck Tee Shirt is a fantastic product with exceptional comfort and style, but comes with a hefty price tag.

"A lot of the jeans for my husband are too big in the seat and legs, but this brand fits him nicely and they are soft and have a little give in the waist. I’ve bought several pairs over the months. The only reason I didn’t give 5 stars was because I ordered 30L and although the jeans say they were 30L, they were too long. I measured inseam and there were almost 32L, so I had to hem.

"I‚Äôm on low carb and have lost over one hundred pounds.  I wasn‚Äôt sure what size to get, so I took a guess and ordered large.  I am  a smidge under 5‚Äô8‚Äù and currently 160 pounds.  I ordered large figuring that if they didn‚Äôt currently fit, they would in another ten or twenty pounds .  They ft really well. They are loose and extremely comfortable.  I was worried about the wrist band, but no worries there.  The waist band is very stretchy,, and placed higher than I thought.  The only thing that bugged me was the button.  It wasn‚Äôt placed quite right or the  buttonhole was not the right size.  They slid off easily when zipped and buttoned, so they are easy enough to slide on and off without bothering about the button! I love these.  I ordered two pair but only received one, but I have another order coming tomorrow, so hopefully it‚Äôs in there.  If it isn‚Äôt  you know who I‚Äôn going to call, and it isn‚Äôt Ghostbusters!  I seriously love these pants.  They are longish like the picture but they don‚Äôt drag on the floor.  I‚Äôm going to be wearing these all summer, fall, etc.  They are keepers. I‚Äôm probably between sizes now, so when I order again, I will go medium.  Even baggy, these are delightful, and a great  investment, and I can easily have them taken in.  No downside for me; I‚Äôm  definitely buying more after I i get to my goal weight.  These pants make me look  really thin and I‚Äôm not quite there yet.  Low carb  and these pants put me in a happy place.Updated:I continued to lose weight after writing the above review.  If, like me, you are watching your weight, I recommend going down a size, or waiting to buy them.  I ordered these again in a medium, when I got down to 146.  They fit very well, and the elastic waist ensures maximum comfort, and the legs and seat are very comfortable and not tight.  The only difference I noticed was that the legs were not wide leg as the others are, but more of a boot cut.  This may be because of the lymph edema.  I love the green, but the medium purple pair I got, is more brown than purple,  and brown is not a color I like, but they‚Äôre fine and fit great.  I also have the light green and the gray, so you know I like these pants!  They are well made and comfortable.  These don‚Äôt shrink in the wash, and are soft, and very pleasant to wear.

"There is nothing anywhere near as well-made as the Wrangler 13MWZ jeans. You just can't beat 'em with a stick!

I still have some I bought in 2013.In my opinion the pre-washed (13WMZPW) are the better choice as one doesn't have to go through multiple washings to get them just right.

"I recently picked up a pair of these Wrangler shorts, and I have to say, they have quickly become a staple in my summer wardrobe.

"If you’re looking to channel your inner cowboy with a modern twist, the Wrangler 13MWZ Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jeans are just the ticket. These jeans are built to last, offering the classic look and rugged durability Wrangler is known for, but with a comfortable fit that won’t make you feel like you’re wearing a pair of bricks. Whether you’re working on the ranch, kicking back at the bar, or heading to a casual outing, these jeans have you covered in both style and function.Pros: 1. Durable Construction: Made from tough denim, these jeans can stand up to the rigors of outdoor work or a long day of wear. They’re tough enough for the job, but comfortable enough for downtime. 2. Classic Cowboy Fit: The 13MWZ cut gives you that authentic cowboy look with a bit of room in the seat and thigh, while still offering a slim, straight fit down the leg. This jean will fit the bill if you’re looking for something both classic and practical. 3. Timeless Style: With Wrangler’s signature five-pocket styling and copper rivets, these jeans have a classic western style that’s never out of place. You’ll be ready to ride, dance, or just look good while standing still. 4. Comfortable Waist: The waistband sits just right, providing a comfortable fit without digging into your sides, making these jeans easy to wear all day. 5. Versatile Tan Color: The tan color works well with almost any outfit. Whether you’re pairing them with a plaid shirt or a t-shirt, they’re easy to dress up or down.Cons: 1. Stiff at First: Like most durable denim jeans, these may feel a bit stiff when you first wear them. You might need to break them in a bit before they start feeling more comfortable, but once you do, they’ll be your go-to jeans. 2. May Require Regular Sizing Adjustments: If you’re in between sizes, you might find that they run slightly large, especially after a few washes. You may need to try on a couple of sizes or plan for a slight shrinkage after washing. 3. Limited Stretch: These jeans are made from 100% cotton, so they lack the stretch you might find in modern jeans. If you’re looking for a more flexible, stretchy material, these might not give you the same comfort.For anyone seeking the classic, hardworking appeal of cowboy jeans without sacrificing style or comfort, the Wrangler 13MWZ Cowboy Cut Original Fit Jeans are an excellent choice. The sturdy construction, iconic fit, and timeless design make them a must-have for any denim lover or aspiring cowboy.

This is a wonderfully soft material with the perfect amount of stretch. The color is gorgeous (and just as pictured) and it isn't see through. I love the bit of flair the ruffled sleeve gives. It makes this top interesting without being over the top. The length in the torso is perfect and the cut is flattering. I love that you can dress it up or down and wear it for a variety of occasions and settings.,this is a wonderfully soft material with the perfect amount of stretch the color is gorgeous and just as pictured and it isnt see through i love the bit of flair the ruffled sleeve gives it makes this top interesting without being over the top the length in the torso is perfect and the cut is flattering i love that you can dress it up or down and wear it for a variety of occasions and settings,1

"These jeans fit like the proverbial glove in the waist / glute / thigh area, but I have genetically huge calf muscles (even without working them in the gym,) and the cut of these jeans is fairly tight from the knee downward.  They'll stretch with use of course, so I can still wear them, but if I were going to do a Rev B on these I'd take into account the fact that people who are gym rats will also work their calves. Which means a bit more circumferential span is needed there.They don't need much of a tweak - else you'd end up with lower legs that are relaxed-fit-baggy - but maybe another inch in total circumference at the calf. When I bend down for something and stand back up these ride up my calves and stick there, I've suddenly got the Pee-Wee Herman high-water style and have to pull them back down.Not a big deal though. Again they *will* stretch, they are still an excellent fit, they're inexpensive, they're available in a solid, dark indigo dye. Call me strange but I'm not enthused at the idea of buying jeans that look like they've been pre-worn for six months by a garage mechanic with a serious incontinence problem. If there's some kind of perceived stylishness in jeans that are visibly worn, buying them pre-stressed is as lame as buying a guitar with the paint pre-worn.  Like Oh, dig ME, I've used these so intensely that the paint is worn off.  Except... umm, not really.  No.  Just... no. Best of all these are available in 28 length on 32 waist, which eliminates a big peeve of mine vis-à-vis jeans:Manufacturers sell pants based on waist vs. inseam measurements, and while the waist measurement is a definite thing, the inseam is not.  Tailors typically measure your inseam from the point of direct contact with your groin down to your ankle.  So think about it, or better yet just stand up right now and check this out: When you're standing, whatever pants you're wearing do *not* magically stay snugged right up to your Naughty Bits. Rather, the actual cross-seam where the inseam starts will generally hang at least an inch or two *below* the actual, physical surface of your body from which the inseam usually gets measured.Which means - sur-vey SEZ? - the pants you buy with your tailor-measured inseam will be too long, and you're going to be walking around on top of that last inch of cuff, cursing the fact with every step.  Unless you go to the expense and hassle of having them altered after the fact. So... a selection of inseam dimensions that actually matches people's true pant-leg length!  Amazing!  The only thing Amazon - and the whole of the garment industry - could do better is offer men's jeans with those tailor-assumption-inseam options extending all the way down to 26 or 27.  We're not all bean-poles out here. I would argue that the vast majority of men, at least in N. America, are shorter than the garment industry weirdly assumes.I'm writing this before having done a wash and with only a day's wear, so I can't comment on how durable the dye is.  But at least it's at an intense, deep blue as a starting point - and assuming the dye is of decent quality that's the best you can ask for.[Update 07-27-24: All of the above applies - still a good pair of jeans - but I'm not happy with how the dye is fading. There's a serious fade on both the front and back of the thighs but nowhere else, so the result is that cheesy two-tone thing that screams Dig these bargain jeans I got from K-Mart!  I probably won't be buying more of these until (unless) I start seeing raves about how this problem - and the calf-size problem - have been corrected in a Rev.

"You can wear them, they are made of fabric. They are moderately comfortable. I do not feel restricted in them, nor do I feel naked. In fact, I feel at least half-clothed when I wear them. They are visually unremarkable, and well suited to conceal some or all of your thighs. People will not really notice you are wearing these shorts, it will be more of an observation like that man has shorts that doesn't really feel like an observation. Sometimes people should wear pants, and when I wear pants, sometimes I wear these shorts. They are shorts and I wear them and half of my legs and all of my tush and crotch are concealed from casual view. Sometimes if I forget, or do not feel like it, I will wear them without underwear. I think this is fun to do sometimes, but not at formal occasions. I would say these are not formal shorts. If I was to wear these at a gala, people might notice me wearing them and think that man is wearing shorts and maybe this would be thought with disapproval, or in shock. Sometimes it is hard to access the pockets, and I think this suboptimal, since if your hands struggle to find or go into the pocket, you cannot get or deposit what you wish. Personally, I wish I had more pockets, and even a pocket on my tummy sometimes, but not a uterus like a kangaroo's, but more of a furry little place I could put things, but I also think this is unrealistic, a big flap of hairy skin would be scary to really live with.

"I have both and am wearing both; alternatively, I can speak the pros and cons of both.Hoka Bondi 8 is a cushioned shoe; Brooks Max is the equivalent of I; both are comparable in proof. Here are the significant differences:1. Hoka Bondi is heavier and too soft; it makes you feel tired after a long walk, even though it is cushioned well. Still, it also feels that the cushion is high and too thick, which may make you think that sometimes you are not balanced well. I sometimes feel that I am dragging my feet moving forward.2. Brooks have more support and is firmer than Hoka, I like it better.3. Brooks appears to be more durable. As I started wearing Brooks more for my daily walk, I noticed they wear better than Hoka. While Hoka's bottom already shows signs of wear, Brooks does not, even though I wear them more.This review is subjective to my feelings about both shoes.

"My expectations were low -- how good could shirts that sell 3 for $30 be?  No one will mistake these for an expensive designer shirt, but I was shocked and pleasantly pleased at how nice these shirts are for the money.  The medium-weight polyester fabric has a touch of shininess that is typical for inexpensive poly fabrics, but is comfortable against the skin and has a little give/stretch.  My size medium was slightly larger than my favorite name-brand polos -- about one-inch bigger in circumference in the body and armholes, so fit was a little looser than I prefer, but not saggy or baggy.  I liked the colors and the striped trim on the sleeves and collar.  Construction was good with even stitching and seems.  The buttonholes are slightly tight, but work OK.  Haven't laundered yet, but will update the review if there's any problem.Bottom line - At $10 each, these are an incredibly good deal for a decent looking polo shirt.",my expectations were low  how good could shirts that sell  for  be  no one will mistake these for an expensive designer shirt but i was shocked and pleasantly pleased at how nice these shirts are for the money  the mediumweight polyester fabric has a touch of shininess that is typical for inexpensive poly fabrics but is comfortable against the skin and has a little givestretch  my size medium was slightly larger than my favorite namebrand polos  about oneinch bigger in circumference in the body and armholes so fit was a little looser than i prefer but not saggy or baggy  i liked the colors and the striped trim on the sleeves and collar  construction was good with even stitching and seems  the buttonholes are slightly tight but work ok  havent laundered yet but will update the review if theres any problembottom line  at  each these are an incredibly good deal for a decent looking polo shirt,1

I got first a Medium and was too long.  the fitting was good but just long.  Then I returned the medium and ordered a small and was still long, but then too tight on my bust. Had to return.

"I ordered this hooded flannel shirt for my teenage son for Christmas. Unfortunately, they had sent an XXXL instead of just a regular large. The outside package said Large, but the shirt was definitely a bigger size. No worries. They immediately sent out the correct size. Actually, my son, who is about 5'8 and less than 140 pounds, probably could have gotten away with a medium, but he chose a large. I guess he prefers a looser style. He likes to wear it open with a rock t-shirt underneath. The directions say to hang it up after washing to air dry, so that's what I have been doing, and it has held up nicely. It is thicker than the other hooded flannel shirts that he owns, and it seems to be of quality material. It isn't thick like a flannel jacket, if that's what you are looking for.

"So I’m 510 and 245 ish, I ordered the 2XL and it fits good, XL would’ve “fit” better but this is an outer layer that breaks the wind and keeps water off of you, so with the 2xl I’m able to wear layers under it to keep me warm. I wear this over a viktos chest rig and was still comfortable.Pros:hoodie can roll up and be tucked awayReally like the cuff adjustmentPit zips to let out heatThe location of the front hand pockets,  I’ve had others that had the pockets too  far to the rear and made ituncomfortableLast thing is the hood and collar, large and  sticks out far enough to cover the brim of  your hatThere are other things but these are my  favoritesCons: the pit zips, if you’re wearing short sleeves under this and it’s cold out, these zippers are just as coldAlthough it has plenty of pockets, I believe the one on the left sleeve at your wrist is pointless imo, I can’t think of anything I would store there other than some kind of paper, anything with any weight will twist the sleeve, can’t stand to feel something twisted. Would’ve been better to have an exterior chest pocket for a cell phone imo.On the bottom of the main front zipper, it has 2 zippers? Maybe this serves a legit purpose that I’ve not seen but for me, it’s aggravating sometimes trying to get it unzipped because they have to be perfect for it to come off. I’ll probably try and take one of them off.Overall I really like it, especially price wise,",so i’m  and  ish i ordered the xl and it fits good xl would’ve “fit” better but this is an outer layer that breaks the wind and keeps water off of you so with the xl i’m able to wear layers under it to keep me warm i wear this over a viktos chest rig and was still comfortableproshoodie can roll up and be tucked awayreally like the cuff adjustmentpit zips to let out heatthe location of the front hand pockets  i’ve had others that had the pockets too  far to the rear and made ituncomfortablelast thing is the hood and collar large and  sticks out far enough to cover the brim of  your hatthere are other things but these are my  favoritescons the pit zips if you’re wearing short sleeves under this and it’s cold out these zippers are just as coldalthough it has plenty of pockets i believe the one on the left sleeve at your wrist is pointless imo i can’t think of anything i would store there other than some kind of paper anything with any weight will twist the sleeve can’t stand to feel something twisted would’ve been better to have an exterior chest pocket for a cell phone imoon the bottom of the main front zipper it has  zippers maybe this serves a legit purpose that i’ve not seen but for me it’s aggravating sometimes trying to get it unzipped because they have to be perfect for it to come off i’ll probably try and take one of them offoverall i really like it especially price wise,1

"I recommend using the try before you buy as I ordered a set too large, so I returned them and got the next size down and they were a perfect fit. The shirts end up costing $20per but they fit perfectly, feel and look excellent!

"Love this blouse, but the color is a bit light for burgundy which is why 4 stars, not 5. However, it is a nice color and deeply applied. I purchased a large in this color. I am a size large, 5.6 feet, 155lb, 38 small c, the blouse fits perfectly and the wave stitching is lovely.It came undamaged with no holes or loose threads. The material is moderately soft and the fabric weight is good and not heavy, but not see-through either. The garment has a slight stretch and it drapes nicely over the hips. If you are wider on bottom than top--size up for the drape.The style is lovely with the waves and the cap sleeves. It really is flattering and looks classy but not trashy--dressed up or down.

"Hanes ComfortSoft EcoSmart Men's Fleece Sweatpants are basically the official uniform for anyone who’s decided that regular pants are just an unnecessary societal construct. These sweatpants aren’t just clothing—they’re a lifestyle choice, one that says, “I could do real pants, but why?”First Impressions:The moment you slip into these bad boys, it’s like your legs have been given their own personal cloud to lounge on. Seriously, I’m pretty sure these sweatpants are softer than my hopes and dreams. And the fleece? Oh man, it’s like a hug from a really cozy bear who’s also really into saving the environment, because these pants are EcoSmart, after all. That’s right, you’re saving the planet—in sweatpants. Take that, jeans!The Fit:Let’s talk fit. These pants are roomy. Like, “I could fit an extra sandwich in my pocket and you wouldn’t even know” roomy. They’ve got that classic “I’ve completely abandoned all attempts at impressing anyone” vibe, but in a way that’s kind of charming. The waistband is adjustable, so whether you’ve just finished a workout or just finished a pizza (no judgment), these pants will expand or contract to match your life choices. Elastic cuffs? Oh yeah, you bet. They’re keeping things in place, but not too tight—just tight enough to remind you that you’re still a functioning human.Fashion Forward?Fashionable? Well, let’s just say no one’s going to mistake these for runway couture, but who cares? Sweatpants don’t need to be fashionable. They’re timeless. Whether you’re working from home, binge-watching a show, or just staring out the window wondering when it’s acceptable to take a nap, these pants are the perfect companion. Plus, they come in multiple colors, so you can technically have one for each day of the week. That’s basically the same as putting effort into your wardrobe, right?Durability:These things are built to last. I’m pretty sure they’d survive an apocalypse. You could probably wear them every day for a month straight (no judgment if you do), and they’d still hold up. Plus, they’re EcoSmart, which means they’re made with recycled materials. So not only are you avoiding real pants, but you’re also helping save the planet. Talk about multitasking!The Comfy Test:I did a “Comfy Test,” which involves lying on the couch in various positions for hours and seeing if the pants pass. Spoiler: they absolutely do. Sitting, slouching, sprawling—these pants support it all. I’m pretty sure they could double as pajamas if I weren’t already living in them during the day.",hanes comfortsoft ecosmart mens fleece sweatpants are basically the official uniform for anyone who’s decided that regular pants are just an unnecessary societal construct these sweatpants aren’t just clothing—they’re a lifestyle choice one that says “i could do real pants but why”first impressionsthe moment you slip into these bad boys it’s like your legs have been given their own personal cloud to lounge on seriously i’m pretty sure these sweatpants are softer than my hopes and dreams and the fleece oh man it’s like a hug from a really cozy bear who’s also really into saving the environment because these pants are ecosmart after all that’s right you’re saving the planet—in sweatpants take that jeansthe fitlet’s talk fit these pants are roomy like “i could fit an extra sandwich in my pocket and you wouldn’t even know” roomy they’ve got that classic “i’ve completely abandoned all attempts at impressing anyone” vibe but in a way that’s kind of charming the waistband is adjustable so whether you’ve just finished a workout or just finished a pizza no judgment these pants will expand or contract to match your life choices elastic cuffs oh yeah you bet they’re keeping things in place but not too tight—just tight enough to remind you that you’re still a functioning humanfashion forwardfashionable well let’s just say no one’s going to mistake these for runway couture but who cares sweatpants don’t need to be fashionable they’re timeless whether you’re working from home bingewatching a show or just staring out the window wondering when it’s acceptable to take a nap these pants are the perfect companion plus they come in multiple colors so you can technically have one for each day of the week that’s basically the same as putting effort into your wardrobe rightdurabilitythese things are built to last i’m pretty sure they’d survive an apocalypse you could probably wear them every day for a month straight no judgment if you do and they’d still hold up plus they’re ecosmart which means they’re made with recycled materials so not only are you avoiding real pants but you’re also helping save the planet talk about multitaskingthe comfy testi did a “comfy test” which involves lying on the couch in various positions for hours and seeing if the pants pass spoiler they absolutely do sitting slouching sprawling—these pants support it all i’m pretty sure they could double as pajamas if i weren’t already living in them during the day,1

"I recently purchased the 4-pack of 100% polyester polos, and overall, I’m very pleased with my purchase. Here’s a quick breakdown of my experience:**Pros:**- **Comfort:** These polos are lightweight and breathable, which makes them perfect for warmer weather or active days. The fabric feels soft against the skin, and I’ve found them comfortable to wear for extended periods.- **Durability:** After a few washes, the colors have held up well without any noticeable fading. The stitching seems solid, and I haven’t experienced any pilling or fraying so far.- **Fit:** The sizing is true to size. They’re not too tight or too baggy, providing a nice, relaxed fit that’s still presentable for casual or semi-formal occasions.- **Value for Money:** Getting a 4-pack at this price point is a great deal! It’s perfect for work, outings, or even casual golfing.**Cons:**- **Wrinkle Resistance:** While polyester is generally known for being wrinkle-resistant, these polos still tend to wrinkle a bit if left folded or crumpled for too long. It’s not a dealbreaker but something to keep in mind.- **Style:** These polos are fairly basic in terms of design. If you’re looking for something more fashion-forward, these may not be the best choice. But if you need a reliable staple, they work great.**Final Thoughts:**For the price and quality, this 4-pack of 100% polyester polos is a solid purchase. They’re versatile, comfortable, and durable enough to last through regular wear. Just keep in mind that they may require a bit of ironing and aren’t the most stylish option out there.

The photo shows what the shorts looked like as received.  There’s quite a few wrinkles and a 3” length of each crease is double creased.  I find it hard to get the wrinkles out of 100% polyester material so that’s why I rated these 4 stars.  Otherwise these shorts have some high quality features.  The fabric is thick and has a little stretch to it.  All of the sewing is first rate and there are nice mesh pockets.  The shorts have 5 belt loops that are firmly attached.  The front zipper appears to be very well made and it should hold up nicely.  I ordered size 38 and they were slightly large so if you like your shorts to fit snug consider ordering one size smaller than your usual size.,the photo shows what the shorts looked like as received  there’s quite a few wrinkles and a ” length of each crease is double creased  i find it hard to get the wrinkles out of  polyester material so that’s why i rated these  stars  otherwise these shorts have some high quality features  the fabric is thick and has a little stretch to it  all of the sewing is first rate and there are nice mesh pockets  the shorts have  belt loops that are firmly attached  the front zipper appears to be very well made and it should hold up nicely  i ordered size  and they were slightly large so if you like your shorts to fit snug consider ordering one size smaller than your usual size,1

Whether I‚Äôm lounging on the couch or out for a morning jog, I never feel uncomfortable.I was pleasantly surprised by how well they fit. The tapered leg design gives them a modern look, making them versatile enough to be dressed up with a stylish top or kept casual with a basic tee. They come in a range of sizes and lengths, accommodating various body types, which is always a bonus!After multiple washes, I can confidently say that these sweatpants hold up beautifully. The color hasn‚Äôt faded, and the fabric hasn‚Äôt pilled, which is often a concern with lower-quality sweatpants. They retain their shape and softness, proving to be a worthwhile investment.What I love most is their versatility. I‚Äôve worn them for lounging, workouts, and even casual outings. They pair well with sneakers for a sporty look or can be styled with boots and a chic jacket for a more put-together vibe.They come in a variety of colors and patterns, allowing me to express my personal style. I opted for a classic black pair, but I‚Äôm seriously considering picking up a few more in different shades!If you‚Äôre looking for sweatpants that offer unparalleled comfort, style, and durability, look no further! These have exceeded my expectations in every aspect. I wholeheartedly recommend them to anyone seeking a perfect blend of comfort and trendiness.

"Personally I LOVE the Bolter brand t shirts, but since they seem to no longer exist, and Kennedy Todd brand which I got last time when I couldn't find any more Bolter ones, which Kennedy Todd is basically identical to- I broke down and tried these. Growing up in the 80s, quality and fit of the cheap brands was a million times better than it is now. I'm sick of trying to save money by buying the cheap brands, only to have them shrink 6-8 inches in width in 6 months or less, immediately have holes in them, etc. This was the first time buying a designer brand, and well they're thinner and lighter weight than I expected for starters. They get larger after wearing for only 1-2 hours too; the neckline gets much lower, they fit looser and just stretch out a lot. Haven't washed enough to know if they will shrink yet or not. Didn't notice any holes or loose threads at least, which is a good start. Probably by the time I need new shirts again, these won't be an option anymore either, and I'll have to try something else; living in the northeast we don't get any products of any kind that aren't either factory screw ups, or discontinued/recalled/stuff nobody else wanted in the rest of the country for a tenth of what we have to pay for it years later, so not being able to have any brand loyalty is pretty much a given. Overall these seem ok; pricey for no real reason, but decent. Everything costs an arm and a leg up here anyway, so cheap crap is overpriced as all get out too.

"I bought this brand and another brand to compare. I really like the fabric and design of these pants. They are not flimsy, but rather a nice quality weight fabric. The design is also nice with a dressier look than just your average beach pant. I ordered khaki and the color is exactly as expected. For reference, I wear a 32x32 jean and ordered a size medium. Here's where I ran into some problems. The pants I received fit perfectly in the waist. The length, although wearable, is a little shorter than I like. I didn't wash the pants, but if they ever shrink, then I really won't be able to comfortably wear them at a shorter length. I think the waist would probably be ok. Narrowing the leg of the pant would probably help give a different look to the pants. When I compared the length of these pants to the other brand I bought, there was only about a 1/2 inch difference in length. However, the other brand is more of a tapered leg and looks way longer to the eye despite the very minor difference in length. I'm not sure if the short pant length is relegated to this particular pair, since other reviewers said the pants they received were long? I may try another pair to see if they come longer next time? The overall cut is fuller, so it looks weird to have a short pant leg. Overall, I like the quality of the pants and would recommend them provided you receive a size that fits properly. I was disappointed because I like the large color selection and the quality of these.

"This isn't a shirt for casual wear, this is most definitely a blouse for an office without a blazer-level dress code. The fabric is on the rougher side, which is the reason I dinged a star, but overall it's a good blouse. My favorite part are the sleeves, which are wide and flowing. They hit at the perfect length so nothing digs into your underarm (not that these would dig), but they also have a slit on the top to allow for additional flow. They're not cold-shoulder level slits, just something that gives some additional movement.The neckline is rather high, but it closes with a button clasp at the back, so there's no worry about getting it over your head without ruining your hair or makeup. The pleats across the bust are a nice addition to give the shirt some additional structure so it's not just a plain, loose blouse. Overall, it's a good addition to a business casual wardrobe.",this isnt a shirt for casual wear this is most definitely a blouse for an office without a blazerlevel dress code the fabric is on the rougher side which is the reason i dinged a star but overall its a good blouse my favorite part are the sleeves which are wide and flowing they hit at the perfect length so nothing digs into your underarm not that these would dig but they also have a slit on the top to allow for additional flow theyre not coldshoulder level slits just something that gives some additional movementthe neckline is rather high but it closes with a button clasp at the back so theres no worry about getting it over your head without ruining your hair or makeup the pleats across the bust are a nice addition to give the shirt some additional structure so its not just a plain loose blouse overall its a good addition to a business casual wardrobe,1

The “brown” is apparently a different weave or pattern, because it continues to remain large no matter how often ii is washed in hot water and dried in hi-temp dryer.Decent value for $32.

The jacket is one of the warmest jackets I ever owned. Once zipped up to the max it covers my lower face perfectly from the wind and chill. It has a very very soft feeling exterior and warm fur feeling interior. They claim this jacket is filled with down feathers and no it is not. The fine print says warm as down. But the reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is the ZIPPER. The zipper gets hung up alot of times and has to be reset on track alot. I have a cheaper hoodie that I've never had that issue from. But other than that I love it. It is a tad bit over sized. I wear a medium and ordered a medium but it feels like a large. 4 stars final answer.

"I have two pairs of the Crossroads (in army and anthracite which is bluish-grey) and two of the Lee Extreme Motion Swope shorts (shadow and black). The overall fit of the Swope shorts is the same but it's a heavier material so good for fall and spring. The cargo pockets also have a button instead of velcro that's on the Crossroads. These are the only shorts I'll ever wear now.What I love about the shorts is how lightweight and breathable they are. The fit is snug on the waist but because of the built-in nylon and spandex, it provides great flexibility. They don't feel too tight nor loose and you can wear them without a belt - or a lightweight one. When you're sitting down, the waist and crotch are relaxed so your boys will be free of any pressure. Length hits right just at the knees.I often wear them for bicycle riding, mountain biking, and skateboarding. The material makes them great for sports in general. I'm a professional dog walker so the cargo pockets are handy for storing poop bags. Underneath the right pocket is a hole that's perfect for your phone. I have a Google Pixel 4a and slights right in.Pricing is awesome as well at $30 a pair. Most shorts like this cost $50-$60. They are super affordable so be sure to stock up and buy three or four pairs to last you the next couple of years.Note: if you order the army color, it's not olive green but more like sage green.",i have two pairs of the crossroads in army and anthracite which is bluishgrey and two of the lee extreme motion swope shorts shadow and black the overall fit of the swope shorts is the same but its a heavier material so good for fall and spring the cargo pockets also have a button instead of velcro thats on the crossroads these are the only shorts ill ever wear nowwhat i love about the shorts is how lightweight and breathable they are the fit is snug on the waist but because of the builtin nylon and spandex it provides great flexibility they dont feel too tight nor loose and you can wear them without a belt  or a lightweight one when youre sitting down the waist and crotch are relaxed so your boys will be free of any pressure length hits right just at the kneesi often wear them for bicycle riding mountain biking and skateboarding the material makes them great for sports in general im a professional dog walker so the cargo pockets are handy for storing poop bags underneath the right pocket is a hole thats perfect for your phone i have a google pixel a and slights right inpricing is awesome as well at  a pair most shorts like this cost  they are super affordable so be sure to stock up and buy three or four pairs to last you the next couple of yearsnote if you order the army color its not olive green but more like sage green,1

The fit was exactly as advertised, and after multiple washes, these jeans still look and feel great. I’ve bought several pairs, and they all hold up well, proving their worth time and again.

"I am a 61 yr old female school teacher.  As in previous reviews these are a bit snug. I do order a lot of my shoes in men’s because they generally have a wider toe box.  This pair seems to be a little narrow for a man’s shoe.  These look fine and I’m not sure how they’re gonna hold up all day teaching school however they look good and for the price I’ll keep them and try them out.  My main issue with the shoe is the tongue is short and it hits right where the front of my ankle bends.  I’m not sure how that is going to work out.  I am going to clothes pin that over and mess with it to see if I can get it more pliable. Anyway they do look good.  They do not have very much padding in the foot bed, so we’ll see.",i am a  yr old female school teacher  as in previous reviews these are a bit snug i do order a lot of my shoes in men’s because they generally have a wider toe box  this pair seems to be a little narrow for a man’s shoe  these look fine and i’m not sure how they’re gonna hold up all day teaching school however they look good and for the price i’ll keep them and try them out  my main issue with the shoe is the tongue is short and it hits right where the front of my ankle bends  i’m not sure how that is going to work out  i am going to clothes pin that over and mess with it to see if i can get it more pliable anyway they do look good  they do not have very much padding in the foot bed so we’ll see,1
"The thickness of the material is good and added warmth on colder days with fleece lining throughout. Cuffs at ankles are nice and fitting, not to tight or bothersome. Length is perfect.  The waist has a wider elastic than most with the tie strings sewn into the middle. These sweatpants stay up on the waist without tying, even with keys and wallet. I would tie anyway because I usually carry my phone in my pocket if I don't have a jacket or coat. Seams appear to be well seen.  No zippers on the 2 side pockets, but they're deep so nothing should be to where it's gonna fall out. Good quality sweatpants for the price.

"I appreciate the fact that this has a 1 and 1/2 in extending elastic band that automatically extends to make sure the pants fit better. The way that they fit is quite flattering and it's got a pretty good wearability to it. That would pass my minimum scale.

"I recently purchased this six-pack of black undershirts from Amazon, and I must say I am thoroughly impressed with my purchase. These undershirts have quickly become a staple in my wardrobe, and here's why.First and foremost, the comfort level of these undershirts is outstanding. The fabric is soft against the skin, providing a smooth and pleasant feel throughout the day. Whether I'm wearing them under a dress shirt at the office or paired with casual wear on the weekends, these undershirts consistently deliver on comfort.The fit is another standout feature. These shirts have a perfect balance of snugness and flexibility, contouring to my body without feeling restrictive. The sleeves are just the right length, and the overall length of the shirt ensures it stays neatly tucked in, maintaining a polished look.Durability is crucial when it comes to undershirts, and I'm happy to report that these shirts have held up exceptionally well. After numerous washes, they show no signs of fading, stretching, or losing their shape. The quality of the stitching and fabric speaks to the attention to detail put into their construction.The rich black color hasn't diminished over time, and I appreciate that these undershirts maintain their sleek appearance even after repeated laundering. The color also makes them versatile, seamlessly complementing various outfits.One of the things I value most about this purchase is the affordability. A six-pack at this price point is an excellent deal, especially considering the quality of the product. It's a cost-effective way to build up a collection of reliable undershirts without breaking the bank.In conclusion, I highly recommend these black undershirts from Amazon. They offer a winning combination of comfort, quality, and affordability. Whether you're dressing for a professional setting or casual occasions, these undershirts are a reliable and stylish choice.

They are a nice design touch that dresses the shirt up a little and makes it fun.I am a little disappointed in the color.  I expected it to be more maroon / wine than red based on the pics, and think i would have liked it a bit more if it was that deeper and richer winter color.  Don't get me wrong.  This color is absolutely beautiful and compliments my skin tone nicely.  But it doesn't work quite with the outfit I had in mind when I ordered it.Still very happy with it and highly recommend.

"I recently purchased a pair of black cargo shorts and they are a great value purchase. The fit is just right, not too loose or too tight, and the size is spot-on. The color is a classic black that goes well with any outfit.The pockets on these shorts are spacious and can hold a lot of items without looking bulky. I can easily carry my phone, wallet, keys, and even a few snacks without any issues.My only minor gripe is the back pocket with the protective flap. While it adds an extra layer of security, I personally find it a bit cumbersome to lift the flap every time I need to access the pocket. However, this is a minor inconvenience and doesn't overshadow the overall quality of the shorts.Overall, I am very satisfied with these cargo shorts and would definitely consider buying them again.

"I wore this dress to a wedding last night.. stunning and figure flattering is an understatement. I am 5'2 and embarrassed to say that I gained 10 lb last year so I'm up to 149 lbs and haven't been feeling good about myself. I'm curvy and petite with an hourglass and This dress made me look so good. I purchased a medium. It does come to my ankles but the look was very sleek and made me look taller because it was. I bought the brown one a week ago and after trying it on I bought the black and the army green then after last night I just went on to buy the deep khaki and deep blue. It's heavy and good material.. before I wore it, I threw it in the dryer on steam refresh and it got every single wrinkle out of it for everyone saying it came wrinkled.

"I recently purchased the Amazon Basics workout shirts, and I have been extremely impressed with their quality and performance. These shirts are perfect for any type of workout, whether it's cardio, weightlifting, or yoga.First and foremost, the material of these shirts is excellent. They are made from a moisture-wicking fabric that keeps me dry and comfortable even during the most intense workouts. The shirts also have a slight stretch to them, allowing for a full range of motion without feeling restricted.In terms of fit, the Amazon Basics workout shirts are true to size. They have a flattering and athletic cut that accentuates my physique. The length of the shirts is just right, not too short or too long.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the design of these shirts. The seams are sturdy and well-constructed, ensuring durability over time. The shirts have a tagless design, which eliminates any irritation on the back of the neck.Another great feature of these shirts is their versatility. They can be worn not only for workouts but also as casual everyday wear.

"I bought for the purpose of travel and outdoor use in those times where temps can change drastically from 70F in the morning down to 40F at night.I got this on sale for $20 which was a far cry from $60-120 asking price of other packable down jackets. For the price, it's much warmer than I thought and has well thought out features. So far I've worn this in 42F weather, coldest and just going on a walk I was breaking a bit of a sweat with it half zipped. It has 2 exterior pockets and 2 internal pockets. Personally I wouldn't put too much in these, as I can really feel the thing stretch and drag down. Just gloves, hat, phone etc. should be fine, nothing like a can of soda or something. Water resistance is what you expect for thin nylon stuff, a few drops is fine,  actual rain, get an umbrella or an actual waterproof layer. It's also pretty windproof, took it out in the aftermath of a pseudo hurricane and didn't feel the wind.It packs down pretty well into a 6 inch long 3 inch or so bundle but nothing like the high tech hiking stuff, I just wish there was a shorter loop so I can carabiner it to my pack easier but seems like it was intended to be carried like an umbrella. Also wish it packed into itself rather than have a bag which may get lost one day.  The material imo isn't very durable, I have no rips yet, but I'm not confident and think if I rub on something the wrong way it's going to tear. The stitching seems fine so far, and doesn't seem to be leaking filler yet.Sizing wise, I have a 45 chest and usually wear XL, but this is kinda big even for an XL, maybe because they were antiicpating you layer something like a thick sweater underneath. It is also a bit long for my torso, about 2-3 inches more than I need to sit at my waist. I have 23 sleeves and that fits perfect.I don't expect this to last a long time, but it's useful for the time I'll have it.12/28 edit:So I just used this exactly for what I bought it for because of the huge winter storm that swept across the north and east coast US. Temps went from nearly 60 degrees in daytime all the way down to 23 by late afternooon with extremely high winds that were throwing doors around and knocked some street signs off their mounts, and it was perfect. I just had a t-shirt underneath and on top of this was a gymax waterproof windproof jacket.

No holes and look good for more churchy out to restaurant wear as well as school or playing outside. And the price is awesome.I love that they snap and have zippered crotch. When I put these on Keller, he had so much room all the way around his skinny trunk I was hoping it wouldn't be bulky.  I adjusted both sides quite a bit the jeans don't look weird when fitted and snapped.  He is quite skinny and they are bootcut so the fit is more relaxed. The fabric are a great length and thickness.

Upon receving them I found that they looked exactly as depicted and I didn't see any discrepancies. To me The fabric felt exactly like the ones of the same brand that I buy at the craft store...nice medium thickness,but soft .  I did wash the XL shirts since my husband planed to wear them as they are and they washed nicely.. I didn't see any issues with shrinkage.  However my husband ended up not liking the shirts , because he said the neck was too small for him (he body builds so some shirts just dosnt fit him like he likes ) and he didn't think the fabric felt the same as the ones he already had . So he apparently wont wear them and I unfortunately cannot return them. Im sure I'll find something else to do with them . Now the Large Is what I bought myself so I can make my own graphic Shirts with heat transfer vinyl so it haven't washed those yet , but I'm sure they will be fine. Overall I'm pleased with my order so far and will more than likely order other colors for myself.",i was wanting od green shirts but couldnt find them at the local craft store since they only carry select colors  so of course if you cant find it locally than amazon will more than likely have what you are looking for so i looked and found what i wanted  i ended up buying a  pack of large and xlarge  for more than i would have payed at the craft store but honestly since these were on sale for a decent price i ordered them upon receving them i found that they looked exactly as depicted and i didnt see any discrepancies to me the fabric felt exactly like the ones of the same brand that i buy at the craft storenice medium thicknessbut soft   i did wash the xl shirts since my husband planed to wear them as they are and they washed nicely i didnt see any issues with shrinkage  however my husband ended up not liking the shirts  because he said the neck was too small for him he body builds so some shirts just dosnt fit him like he likes  and he didnt think the fabric felt the same as the ones he already had  so he apparently wont wear them and i unfortunately cannot return them im sure ill find something else to do with them  now the large is what i bought myself so i can make my own graphic shirts with heat transfer vinyl so it havent washed those yet  but im sure they will be fine overall im pleased with my order so far and will more than likely order other colors for myself,1

"Rather than my husband always wearing sneakers with chinos or jeans I came across these Bruno Marc’s.The appearance, reviews and number of buyers is what persuaded me to buy the them over the other brands.He tried them on today but hasn’t worn them so this review is a first impression. I may come back in late September to let you know if there were any negatives about the wear.The shoe out of the box is impressive. Lightweight casual dress. The material of the upper shoe has some type of elastacine (sp) that gives it some stretch/give when you walk. They are breathable which is important to him.I’m not sure if they will stretch overtime but if they do, a tightening of the shoe strings should provide more support.The inner soul is removable for anyone who wears orthotics. My husband does, but after trying them on with and without, he said the foot bed is comfortable enough he may not need the orthopedics for times that he won’t be doing much walking.The shoe laces are a tightly woven fabric over elastic and they hold firmly when tied. The shoe soul is rubberized material, is lightweight and provides for a comfortable sneaker like feel.He buys sizes 8 but his true size is 7.5. He said his toes still have about 1/2” to the end of the shoe and the toe box is very roomy. He likes that because some shoes squeeze his forefoot. No pain in these.We purchased the navy and the color is beautiful.I tried them on and I would be very comfortable wearing them.At this point, we have to give them a 5 star rating. Even though we can’t speak to the performance at this time, we believe they are a good value for the price and construction .

"Ariat jeans are a game-changer for tall men who have struggled to find well-fitting denim. I have learned that Ariat jeans are the go-to choice for men who are tall and lean or have a lanky build.What sets Ariat jeans apart is their attention to detail and quality craftsmanship. The jeans are made from durable, high-quality materials that are designed to last for years, and they feature reinforced seams and heavy-duty hardware. The result is a pair of jeans that can stand up to whatever you throw at them, whether you're working on the ranch, out on the town, or simply running errands.But what really sets Ariat jeans apart is their sizing. Unlike other brands that offer limited sizing options, Ariat jeans are available in a wide range of sizes, including very tall men's sizes. This means that men who are six feet or taller can finally find a pair of jeans that fits well and looks great.What's more, Ariat jeans are designed with comfort in mind. They have a classic, straight-leg fit that provides plenty of room to move, and they're made from stretch denim that moves with you. This means that you can wear them all day without feeling restricted or uncomfortable.Overall, if you're a tall man who has struggled to find jeans that fit well, Ariat jeans are an excellent choice. They're well-made, comfortable, and available in a wide range of sizes, so you can finally find a pair of jeans that looks and feels great.",ariat jeans are a gamechanger for tall men who have struggled to find wellfitting denim i have learned that ariat jeans are the goto choice for men who are tall and lean or have a lanky buildwhat sets ariat jeans apart is their attention to detail and quality craftsmanship the jeans are made from durable highquality materials that are designed to last for years and they feature reinforced seams and heavyduty hardware the result is a pair of jeans that can stand up to whatever you throw at them whether youre working on the ranch out on the town or simply running errandsbut what really sets ariat jeans apart is their sizing unlike other brands that offer limited sizing options ariat jeans are available in a wide range of sizes including very tall mens sizes this means that men who are six feet or taller can finally find a pair of jeans that fits well and looks greatwhats more ariat jeans are designed with comfort in mind they have a classic straightleg fit that provides plenty of room to move and theyre made from stretch denim that moves with you this means that you can wear them all day without feeling restricted or uncomfortableoverall if youre a tall man who has struggled to find jeans that fit well ariat jeans are an excellent choice theyre wellmade comfortable and available in a wide range of sizes so you can finally find a pair of jeans that looks and feels great,1

So I wouldn’t recommend if you have wide feet.They are fairly comfortable although they don’t offer that much arch support or cushioning.

I didn't need my top layer jacket... I stayed warm ... I remained dry .... I ended up purchasing the Sz: L to allow for layering & for more movement. It worked perfectly ... highly recommend...Item  travels EXCELLENT! .... easy to care for... will likely purchase other colors as needed.... so for me at: 5'7,  170 ... size M for daily casual wear, and size L for winter sports at a bargain price & nothing bulky to store as I live in a tropical climate.

She doesn't have the hour glass anymore after several surgeries, so it's difficult for her to find jeans that fit and look modern. We both wear size 16, but these are 18. Because of my hips I probably need to size up. We'll see how they shrink after washing and report back. Oh and the length is great for tall girls. Petite's may need to hem them or wear heels.My apple shape is in the video modeling for mom. These are okay for the assembly job work, running errands,  for dog walks but not for special occasions.

"I recently purchased a shirt that has quickly become one of my favorites, and I just had to share my thoughts on it. This shirt features fun sleeves that add the perfect amount of flair without overwhelming the overall look. They strike an excellent balance between stylish and practical, making it a standout piece in my wardrobe.One of the first things I noticed about this shirt is its lightweight fabric. While it’s thin, it doesn't feel flimsy or poorly made. In fact, it has a nice quality to it that suggests it will hold up well over time, even with regular wear. The fit is fantastic; it hugs my body in all the right places while still allowing enough room for comfort. Whether I’m dressing it down for a casual outing or dressing it up for a night out, it adapts beautifully to whatever style I’m going for.What I love most about this shirt is its versatility. On a casual day, I can pair it with jeans and sneakers for a laid-back look, and it feels effortlessly chic. On the flip side, when I want to elevate my outfit for a more dressy occasion, I can easily tuck it into a skirt or dress pants, and it instantly transforms into a polished ensemble. This adaptability makes it a staple in my wardrobe, and I can already see it becoming my go-to top for various occasions.In conclusion, this shirt is a delightful blend of style, quality, and versatility. With its fun sleeves, comfortable fit, and lightweight feel, it’s perfect for anyone looking to add a little flair to their outfits. Whether you’re aiming for casual or dressy, this shirt delivers on all fronts.

I would also say, the laundry instructions are Cold water wash, hang dry because it clearly states don't tumble dry.  This isn't an issue for me because I wash my yoga pants in cold on delicate and hang them to dry.

For me the sizing of 12.5 was correct.  Shoe feels very comfortable and sole is flexible but not overly which allows for a comfortable walk especially for those having toe joint issues. The color I choice is very light and I know it will show dirt pretty easy .  It is not machine washable.  Only spot leaning by hand so keep that in mind especially if you are looking at very light colors.  The fabric material is very soft and breathable so certainly not water resistant.  I question if it will show surface abrasion wear in a short time.  The only thing I do not care for is the tongue of the shoe is only sewed at the very bottom which leaves the entire sides not attached.  This can leave the tongue moving to the side more than desired while it is being put on and the increased opportunity for foreign items such needle grass to enter the shoe. Just an observation.  Overall I am pleased with the shoe. A good value for the money.

"For reference my husband is 6’2, 205 pounds with broad shoulders, long arms, long legs, and a short torso. He wears a 44L in men’s suits and 36W/34L (pants). His neck is 17.5”. So WTS, here’s how it fit:The jacket is a perfect fit particularly across the back of his shoulders. He can button the top button closest to his neck without feeling chocked/restricted. The arms fall right at the break of his wrists. However, there’s too much room around the waist area but that’s because he’s more narrow at the bottom. The problem is that it causes the slits on the back of the jacket to gap open which looks kinda funky so I’ll have to have it altered for a more tailored look. I will add that the fabric is very nice, not too heavy and the jacket is lined.As for the pants, they are paper thin (see through) and soft. The wooden button is a little difficult to use, as he got tired of trying to dislodge it so he ended up carefully pulling the pants off with them buttoned. The pants fall slightly above his ankles, and the fit is definitely snug around the waist, butt and thighs. My husband also has runner’s thighs and is not comfortable wearing tight or fitted clothing but this is how they’re supposed to fit. So yeah, it’ll take him a minute to get used to it but he only has to wear this for a few hours so he’ll be fine. So IMO the pants are fine but be forewarned that if your (or his) waist is 38+ the pants could potentially be a problem.The colors are like a sherbet coral, creamy white and soft blue. The quality is good and it was delivered in 2 days. Thus far, I have no regrets about this purchase. I hope this helps as there weren’t a lot of reviews at the time of my purchase.",for reference my husband is ’  pounds with broad shoulders long arms long legs and a short torso he wears a l in men’s suits and wl pants his neck is ” so wts here’s how it fitthe jacket is a perfect fit particularly across the back of his shoulders he can button the top button closest to his neck without feeling chockedrestricted the arms fall right at the break of his wrists however there’s too much room around the waist area but that’s because he’s more narrow at the bottom the problem is that it causes the slits on the back of the jacket to gap open which looks kinda funky so i’ll have to have it altered for a more tailored look i will add that the fabric is very nice not too heavy and the jacket is linedas for the pants they are paper thin see through and soft the wooden button is a little difficult to use as he got tired of trying to dislodge it so he ended up carefully pulling the pants off with them buttoned the pants fall slightly above his ankles and the fit is definitely snug around the waist butt and thighs my husband also has runner’s thighs and is not comfortable wearing tight or fitted clothing but this is how they’re supposed to fit so yeah it’ll take him a minute to get used to it but he only has to wear this for a few hours so he’ll be fine so imo the pants are fine but be forewarned that if your or his waist is  the pants could potentially be a problemthe colors are like a sherbet coral creamy white and soft blue the quality is good and it was delivered in  days thus far i have no regrets about this purchase i hope this helps as there weren’t a lot of reviews at the time of my purchase,1
"As my youngest son is growing rapidly, I decided it was time to surprise him with a new set of toddler boys boxer briefs. I loved that this pack came with a set of 10, and it had 7 pairs Monday through Sunday and 3 solid colored ones. It's been so much fun to teach him the spelling of the days and to help recognize the letters. As well as letting him pick his favorite design or color. He is 4 1/2 years old and right in the middle of 4t and 5t clothes. This was true to it's size and fit him perfectly. I love that these are tagless, and the tag print is designed inside. These are super soft, stretchy, and comfortable. Perfect for a preschooler! He is comfortable in these, to play various of sports, wrestling with his big brothers and running around the playground. I love the soft waistband that doesn't put pressure on his waste and wicks moisture, as well as 100% cotton!! Don't forget to tumble dry low in the dryer, or in my case, I just let them air dry.

It makes it look unique. This sweater is super cute. I'm saving Dokotoo under my favorites. I may buy another one in a different color.

"I bought this to take on a trip through the UK, France, and Italy. The jacket I purchased is yellow. I wanted something that would be adequately warm on a cool spring day so I wouldn’t have to bring another sweatshirt or have to pack long sleeve shirts. I also wanted something that folded up very small as I was only taking a backpack for 10 days. This jacket fit the bill perfectly. It comes with a bag which will compress the jacket down to about the size of a smaller shoe, but the way I found best to pack it was to fold it into quarters, flat, and put it on top of my clothes in my backpack. The jacket would compress almost completely flat, adding almost no bulk to my bag. It was like a magic trick how small it became. When I wanted to have it handy, but did not want to carry it, I would stick it through the handle of my backpack, pulling it halfway through, and it would stay there securely when I put my bag into overhead luggage storage on the Italo and Eurostar, making to easy to grab if I became cold.  There were some cold and very windy evenings and nights when we were in London and Paris (50 degrees F, with a strong breeze coming off the Thames and Seine) and this jacket kept me warm with just a t-shirt on underneath. I encountered a brief rain shower on the Path of the Gods and stayed dry and the jacket dried pretty quickly. I can’t speak to how well it would perform in a heavy downpour as that was the only rain I experienced during my trip. Overall, this jacket was perfect for me and at the price point, I was not going to be upset if it got lost, stolen, or ruined. After being stuffed in my bag over and over and shoved into overhead storage, the jacket still looks brand new. Not to mention it looked stylish in all of the photos my wife and I took!

"If you’re reading this, size up a half size when purchasing! These run SMALLER than previous glycerin models!I have always been a size 6.5 WIDE in Brooks and have had several previous “Glycerin” models, so I was very surprised when 6.5 wide was not only too small but too NARROW. I sized up to a 7, and it fits much better.That being said, Brooks is stepping up their game in terms of the style and colors of their shoes. In my opinion, the Glycerin 21 is the most attractive shoe I’ve owned from brooks and the first that doesn’t somewhat resemble “old people shoes”. Looks aside, I will say that I like the fit of the previous model — Glycerin 20 — a bit better. The bottom of the shoes are very padded and heavier like Hokas, which is great for walking but not the best for running.Overall, Brooks is still the best option out there in terms of comfort and traction. I wear brooks every day for my job (on my feet and walking ALL day as a fitness professional), and my feet and back always feel great — unlike with other brands! Great shoe.

"These traditional Jeans by Levi Strauss are really perfect in every respect. Excellent fabric, smooth and skin friendly. There can be no doubt that there are other denims out there, other companies that make excellent Jeans, but Levi Strauss has the brand and the product that leads the pack. It is a tough competitive field but if there is an improvement or inventive idea in how to make a product more comfortable or to last longer Levi Strauss will be putting those improvements into their garments. So true of those traditional patented button rivets that have made their pants last longer since their inception.Let me remind you that Levi Strauss uses very traditional sizing. There is no about to the ABOUT.If you are a size 38 about the waist that is what you will get..and you will have a fine fitting pair of pants.The Jeans were very well packaged and delivered with personal care by the P service.I could not wait to try them on since it had been quite a spell since I had come to need a pair of Levi Strauss Jeans...a few years since my last purchase. This was more or less a test to see if the product was still good quality. It is, so I will be buying more. Levis are always my choice in dressy casuals and you just cant beat the fit and the soft overall comfort that I experienced the moment I put them on.It is really difficult to review something that is so decidedly different in so many respects.I am well satisfied and would speculate with more than a modicum of surety that the Levi Strauss brand will continue in the biz for a good long stretch to come.I give these Traditional britches by Levi Strauss a full five star rating for quality and value.I am wearing them as I write this review. No bind no pinched feeling anywhere.In my opinion that quality and fair pricing is responsible for the popularity of this dry goods store product since the mid 19th century.Get out that cloth tailors tape....measure your waist and inseam and order the size to suit.",these traditional jeans by levi strauss are really perfect in every respect excellent fabric smooth and skin friendly there can be no doubt that there are other denims out there other companies that make excellent jeans but levi strauss has the brand and the product that leads the pack it is a tough competitive field but if there is an improvement or inventive idea in how to make a product more comfortable or to last longer levi strauss will be putting those improvements into their garments so true of those traditional patented button rivets that have made their pants last longer since their inceptionlet me remind you that levi strauss uses very traditional sizing there is no about to the aboutif you are a size  about the waist that is what you will getand you will have a fine fitting pair of pantsthe jeans were very well packaged and delivered with personal care by the p servicei could not wait to try them on since it had been quite a spell since i had come to need a pair of levi strauss jeansa few years since my last purchase this was more or less a test to see if the product was still good quality it is so i will be buying more levis are always my choice in dressy casuals and you just cant beat the fit and the soft overall comfort that i experienced the moment i put them onit is really difficult to review something that is so decidedly different in so many respectsi am well satisfied and would speculate with more than a modicum of surety that the levi strauss brand will continue in the biz for a good long stretch to comei give these traditional britches by levi strauss a full five star rating for quality and valuei am wearing them as i write this review no bind no pinched feeling anywherein my opinion that quality and fair pricing is responsible for the popularity of this dry goods store product since the mid th centuryget out that cloth tailors tapemeasure your waist and inseam and order the size to suit,1

"as a slender, tall woman who is also a senior, I prefer fleece sweatpants for warmth on cold winter days.  Most sweatpants for women, that are in style today, have a cuff, which do not sit at my ankle, so I go to a man's pant for that length and just size down to a small.  I also prefer no cuff for the ease of slipping pants on and off without removing sneakers. Now I have warm pants that hug my legs and are long enough to be stylish.  However, the men's styling  do not conform to the female curves until their worn a few times and stretch a bit in the hip and rear areas.  But they still remain comfortable enough to wear out and not just to the gym.

I like the looks, the specs looked good and they were on sale for a decent price so I bought one for myself as well.I am very happy with them.  Its heavy but not so heavy to uncomfortable.  We have not hit extreme cold yet but we have had some very cold days and have hit some cold days with some high winds putting the wind chill in the teens even flirting with single digit wind chills and this coat was great.  I was really impressed with how well this coat handles the wind.  It does not have a hood, but I did not really want one.

It does not have a hood which I did not want one.  I use an insulated gator and a good with hat and when it's really bad one of my layers will have a hood that I can pull over those for a little extra wind protection.  Just don't turn the heat up too high in the car or you will be pulling over to take it off LOL.

"I recently purchased the 5 Pack Men's Dry Fit T-Shirts for my workout routine, and I couldn't be happier with my purchase. These shirts are a game-changer when it comes to comfort and performance during athletic activities.The first thing that caught my attention was the incredible softness of the material. The fabric feels gentle against the skin, making these shirts exceptionally comfortable to wear, even during intense workouts.

The sizing is accurate, providing a snug yet non-restrictive fit. I appreciate how they contour to the body without feeling too tight, allowing for a full range of motion during any exercise.One of the standout features for me is the breathability of these shirts. Whether I'm running, lifting weights, or doing yoga, the moisture-wicking technology keeps me cool and dry throughout my entire workout. It's a great feeling to stay comfortable and focused without being weighed down by sweat-soaked clothing.The 5-pack is a fantastic value, giving me a variety of colors to choose from. This not only adds a bit of style to my workout wardrobe but also means I can rotate them without worrying about constantly doing laundry.In conclusion, these Dry Fit T-Shirts for men are a must-have for anyone serious about their workouts.

"Ok, so I’m a fabric snob. I grew up in my mom’s dressmaking shop and from an early age was exposed to and taught about the difference in quality between various fabrics. So I pay close attention to weave, hand-feel, texture and durability of fabrics. Knits can be especially tricky when buying online, because you don’t get any of that tactile insight from a picture. And I’ve “kissed a lot of frogs” when buying knit pieces online. Sometimes the picture looks great, but when the piece arrives, it feels cheap and tacky and plastic-like. Not these sweats!!So…I bought 2 pairs of these sweatpants for my son, and they’re awesome. The fabric on these is super-premium and they look like something I spent $120 on:The deets:-The weave on this fabric is incredibly dense and tight so the hand feel is smooth, and the fabric is weightier than you’re going to get with most other sweatpant brands.-These don’t pill!-The “wrong side” or interior side of the fabric that touches the skin is almost velour-like: it’s soft and super snuggly-I would say these run on the slim side, which is a bonus for us. My son is tall and slender and these have a trim fit to them so they look more polished than most sweatpants (he’s 14, about 5’7” and approximately 122lbs and I bought him a men’s size small)I bought these in black and navy, and I’m going to buy, on repeat, as my son grows. Teenager approved: he loves them and they’re an amazing value for the money.",ok so i’m a fabric snob i grew up in my mom’s dressmaking shop and from an early age was exposed to and taught about the difference in quality between various fabrics so i pay close attention to weave handfeel texture and durability of fabrics knits can be especially tricky when buying online because you don’t get any of that tactile insight from a picture and i’ve “kissed a lot of frogs” when buying knit pieces online sometimes the picture looks great but when the piece arrives it feels cheap and tacky and plasticlike not these sweatsso…i bought  pairs of these sweatpants for my son and they’re awesome the fabric on these is superpremium and they look like something i spent  onthe deetsthe weave on this fabric is incredibly dense and tight so the hand feel is smooth and the fabric is weightier than you’re going to get with most other sweatpant brandsthese don’t pillthe “wrong side” or interior side of the fabric that touches the skin is almost velourlike it’s soft and super snugglyi would say these run on the slim side which is a bonus for us my son is tall and slender and these have a trim fit to them so they look more polished than most sweatpants he’s  about ’” and approximately lbs and i bought him a men’s size smalli bought these in black and navy and i’m going to buy on repeat as my son grows teenager approved he loves them and they’re an amazing value for the money,1

"This review is for those of you trying to decide between the Hanes vs. Fruit of the Loom undershirts.Overall, I have to go with Hanes because the neck hole feels more appropriate. Fruit of the Loom is just too large. At the end of the day, the hole will stretch out and show chest hair popping up in the front, and back hair from the back.If the goal is to wear an undershirt for work with a business casual dress shirt (top button open / no tie) I don't want my chest cleavage showing; otherwise I'd get a V-neck.The Hanes shirt is thinner and cooler. BUT, it's also a bit more rough / scratchy. Not in a bad way, but Fruit of the Loom feels super soft in comparison.I'll also mention that after one wear I started noticing threads coming out of the arm seams on the Hanes, whereas Fruit of the Loom have gone through multiple washes and are still as durable as the day I got them. The Hanes haven't fallen apart by any means, but it's something to point out.Both a 2X Hanes and 2XL Fruit of the Loom seem to be the same length.  I have a big gut, so I was worried not having the [L]ong affix for a size option for Hanes meant they would be too short and hard to tuck into my pants, but they tuck great even after washing.Both are great options tbh.  In summary -Hanes for:- Smaller neck- Cooler / lighter fitFruit of the Loom for:- Softer / warmer fit- More durability",this review is for those of you trying to decide between the hanes vs fruit of the loom undershirtsoverall i have to go with hanes because the neck hole feels more appropriate fruit of the loom is just too large at the end of the day the hole will stretch out and show chest hair popping up in the front and back hair from the backif the goal is to wear an undershirt for work with a business casual dress shirt top button open  no tie i dont want my chest cleavage showing otherwise id get a vneckthe hanes shirt is thinner and cooler but its also a bit more rough  scratchy not in a bad way but fruit of the loom feels super soft in comparisonill also mention that after one wear i started noticing threads coming out of the arm seams on the hanes whereas fruit of the loom have gone through multiple washes and are still as durable as the day i got them the hanes havent fallen apart by any means but its something to point outboth a x hanes and xl fruit of the loom seem to be the same length  i have a big gut so i was worried not having the long affix for a size option for hanes meant they would be too short and hard to tuck into my pants but they tuck great even after washingboth are great options tbh  in summary hanes for smaller neck cooler  lighter fitfruit of the loom for softer  warmer fit more durability,1
"Both I and my other half love Scooby, so I had to get these for him.  The undies are made of a microfiber type material, not cotton, so they are silky smooth.  I got the XL for him, he's 6ft, 250 lbs.  Judging by the size chart, he could have worn the large, but he likes things looser rather than tight.

If it were all white or a lighter color, I anticipate it would be see through.Size / Fit:I typically wear a size 6, S, or M for a shirt depending on the style and brand.  I wear a 34D or 36C in bra and am 5'7. I purchased this in a small based on Amazon's recommended sizing, and think it was the right fit for me.  A M would have been too big.  The shirt is a little boxy (vs. fitted shape) and I found the chest area to be a little tight although it's not too bad.  I don't think anyone else would notice and like it enough to keep it.Style:I really like the ruffled neckline and the 3/4 sleeves.  It's a great shirt for the end of summer/beginning of fall.

"These are a great pair of pure cotton no frills blue jeans. As I get older I care more about quality than owning designer brands. And for around 13$ these jeans are a steal. I don't need skinny fit or any special fading. Just give me a good solid colored pair of dark blue jeans and I'm content. These jeans are built for working so if you're mostly just lounging around in them (Like me) they'll last you for ages. I read online that these jeans are very popular with skaters nowadays because they can take a good beating. Even though I can find these at the big box stores I prefer to buy mine on Amazon because they carry the 29 inch inseam. The waist does seem to run a tad small, so if you're in between sizes I would recommend sizing up. Follow the care tag instructions and wash them inside out, and then line dry them or dry them on a drying rack to prolong their longevity and to prevent any shrinkage. Other than that no complaints.

"I was excited to try out the Maamgic Men's 5 Gym Running Shorts, and overall, they didn’t disappoint. The fabric is high-quality, lightweight, and the quick-dry feature really does its job during intense workouts or runs. The design is stylish, and I found the shorts to be comfortable with good breathability, making them great for gym sessions or outdoor runs.What I Loved:Fabric & Quality: The material feels premium and durable. It’s soft against the skin and holds up well after multiple washes.Quick-Dry & Lightweight: These shorts are perfect for hot days or high-intensity workouts, as they dry quickly and don’t feel heavy, even when you’re sweating.Fit & Look: The 5” inseam gives a modern, athletic look, and the fit is spot-on for those who like a slightly shorter style without being too revealing.My Concern:The inner liner was my only issue. While it provides extra support, I found that it wasn’t as snug as I would’ve liked. This led to some discomfort and potential chafing during longer runs, which was a deal-breaker for me. Unfortunately, I decided to return them because of this, as I prefer a more fitted liner for optimal support during my workouts.Overall, these are well-made and stylish workout shorts.

"Update 2-14-2025I still love these shoes! For Christmas I received the Pink, Red, and Grey. I STILL get compliments on them all the time. They are still comfortable. They wash extremely well! Iâ€™ve had to wash them several times since getting them and I THINK I have noticed the pink pair slightly fading on the sides of the sole, but it may have had that slight variance from the color of the fabric when I got them. I canâ€™t really remember. ðŸ¤· Either way, it looks fine. I remove the insole, wash in the washing machine (old standard type with agitator) and reshape and lay on air vent or in front of refrigerator to dry. I feel like I need to add a blue pair to my collection! Oh! And I donâ€™t think I mentioned before about sizing ... it depends on which size chart you use, but I usually wear between an 8-9 in womenâ€™s or a 7 in Menâ€™s. I wear a 7.5 in menâ€™s in these shoes and they fit perfectly! I have a wide foot and sometimes shoes will squeeze just enough for the bones to pinch the nerves in my feet when I walk and these do not! The fabric on the top of the shoe is soft and flexible enough to be comfortable, but firm enough to feel like you have a solid shoe on. Just wanted to update.Original 10-26-2024Iâ€™ll admit, when I bought these, I was skeptical that they would fit, be comfortable and not look like I bought cheap shoes from Amazon, but I was wrong! They fit perfectly. They are comfortable, even after working on my feet all day. And they are cute! Iâ€™ve got the orange and the green pair (so far) and I get compliments on them every time I wear them! They are bright, fun and so far, have held up well! And get this. I have plantar fasciitis. For years Iâ€™ve only been able to wear certain types of shoes and supports. My latest shoe being a classic Birkenstock sandal. Year round. If Iâ€™m walking, they are on my feet. Well a new job required closed toe shoes and I just couldnâ€™t make up my mind. I wear scrub bottoms and a t shirt and Birkenstock really doesnâ€™t have a cute tennis shoe style for that look. I decided to give these a shot, mainly because they were cheap and the colors were bright and fun. Iâ€™m so glad I did! Now, they donâ€™t have the most supportive arch, and they do come with an extra insole I guess if you like more padding. Not really sure. But they are great as is ðŸ¤· I still wear my birks around the house but I wear these several times a week as I rotate them between a couple other styles. Anyway. For me, they are great!!",update i still love these shoes for christmas i received the pink red and grey i still get compliments on them all the time they are still comfortable they wash extremely well iâ€™ve had to wash them several times since getting them and i think i have noticed the pink pair slightly fading on the sides of the sole but it may have had that slight variance from the color of the fabric when i got them i canâ€™t really remember ðÿ¤· either way it looks fine i remove the insole wash in the washing machine old standard type with agitator and reshape and lay on air vent or in front of refrigerator to dry i feel like i need to add a blue pair to my collection oh and i donâ€™t think i mentioned before about sizing  it depends on which size chart you use but i usually wear between an  in womenâ€™s or a  in menâ€™s i wear a  in menâ€™s in these shoes and they fit perfectly i have a wide foot and sometimes shoes will squeeze just enough for the bones to pinch the nerves in my feet when i walk and these do not the fabric on the top of the shoe is soft and flexible enough to be comfortable but firm enough to feel like you have a solid shoe on just wanted to updateoriginal iâ€™ll admit when i bought these i was skeptical that they would fit be comfortable and not look like i bought cheap shoes from amazon but i was wrong they fit perfectly they are comfortable even after working on my feet all day and they are cute iâ€™ve got the orange and the green pair so far and i get compliments on them every time i wear them they are bright fun and so far have held up well and get this i have plantar fasciitis for years iâ€™ve only been able to wear certain types of shoes and supports my latest shoe being a classic birkenstock sandal year round if iâ€™m walking they are on my feet well a new job required closed toe shoes and i just couldnâ€™t make up my mind i wear scrub bottoms and a t shirt and birkenstock really doesnâ€™t have a cute tennis shoe style for that look i decided to give these a shot mainly because they were cheap and the colors were bright and fun iâ€™m so glad i did now they donâ€™t have the most supportive arch and they do come with an extra insole i guess if you like more padding not really sure but they are great as is ðÿ¤· i still wear my birks around the house but i wear these several times a week as i rotate them between a couple other styles anyway for me they are great,1

"I really like these jeans, and having worked in the denim industry for many years this is now my go to jeans. I do have some critique though. The size 12 fits me well except that the waist is a bit big, this is perplexing since I am an apple shape with skinny legs and a larger waist than my natural body size should have. (Did I mention I worked in the denim industry as a pattern maker, so I’m an expert on fit and standard body sizes.) but this problem is wide spread through The industry these days, not just this product.The second issue I have on these jeans is the chain stitched waist band, it is itchy and I usually have to tuck in my shirt to keep it from bothering me (this also helps the pants stay up) the chain stitch is also stretchy so the loose waist gets worse the longer I wear them. If they went to a lock stitch waist band I think it would be more comfortable and help with the stretching out issue.That said, I’m overall very happy with these jeans for the price and being off the rack. I can always alter them.",i really like these jeans and having worked in the denim industry for many years this is now my go to jeans i do have some critique though the size  fits me well except that the waist is a bit big this is perplexing since i am an apple shape with skinny legs and a larger waist than my natural body size should have did i mention i worked in the denim industry as a pattern maker so i’m an expert on fit and standard body sizes but this problem is wide spread through the industry these days not just this productthe second issue i have on these jeans is the chain stitched waist band it is itchy and i usually have to tuck in my shirt to keep it from bothering me this also helps the pants stay up the chain stitch is also stretchy so the loose waist gets worse the longer i wear them if they went to a lock stitch waist band i think it would be more comfortable and help with the stretching out issuethat said i’m overall very happy with these jeans for the price and being off the rack i can always alter them,1

"First off, these shorts are true to size. Extremely comfortable with no binding. All the stitching looks good, and no snags in the material. There are 2 integrated grippers inside the waistband to help keep tucked in shirts in place. There is a small pocket inside the right front pocket, but it's too small and shallow to really serve any purpose. I am concerned about the zipper. Although it works just fine, it's a very fine nylon. To my experience they tend to not hold up well. I will post an update after a month or two of wear.I got these for under $9 a pair on an Amazon limited deal, so they were WELL worth the money",first off these shorts are true to size extremely comfortable with no binding all the stitching looks good and no snags in the material there are  integrated grippers inside the waistband to help keep tucked in shirts in place there is a small pocket inside the right front pocket but its too small and shallow to really serve any purpose i am concerned about the zipper although it works just fine its a very fine nylon to my experience they tend to not hold up well i will post an update after a month or two of weari got these for under  a pair on an amazon limited deal so they were well worth the money,1
I’m actually not as upset as I thought. Okay the coat feels great in my medium size. Fabric and material are good…. except for the material used for the pockets.

The fabric is soft, light weight, but not flimsy.  It has  nice drape and movement.  It came folded in a vacuum bag, the wrinkles and folds ironed out easily.

"Purchased these for a trip to Italy and wanted lots of pockets with zippers.  Could not believe the quality of these for the money.  I wore three pair over the course of three weeks and felt quite secure.  I was able to carry a wallet, cell phone, passports, keys, cash very comfortably and securely.  What was a bonus was how light weight they were and wicked away moisture even on the hottest days.  They were light enough to use as a swimsuit that dried quickly.  With no access to clothes dryers, washing them in the sink and line drying them was a breeze.  In addition, they roll up very small and take up little space in your luggage.

"The fleece sweatpants were great except for two things. First the pockets are incredibly shallow like my hands barely fit up to the wrist in them. With most phones being over 6 inches and many wallets about the same, this is ridiculous. The pockets should be at least 6.5 -7 inches deep.Secondly it's like they had a shortage on the drawstring and didn't really give you enough to properly tie the waist. Thankfully the elastic waistband is fairly taut so it gives you a snug fit. Luckily I have an extra drawstring which I will use to replace this one that's way too short.Other than that it's a pretty good buy.

"This is a really pretty dress, nicer than I expected. I went with an XX based on reviews and the size chart. At 5’5”, this dress goes to my ankles. Because I’m shaped like an apple, the dress is snug through the torso and a heavy shaper is required. Because the shape and color are lovely, I’m going to buckle down, swimlaps, and cut the ice cream until I have a bit more room. This is perfect for my summer events.There is zero stretch in this 100% rayon dress. If you’re at all plus sized or big through the belly or breasts, I’d recommend sizing up.I thought the design on the green had a tiny bit of black on the design, but the design is all brown. Super cute.Update:With 10 days of limiting ice cream and wine and with the help of a solid shaper, the dress was perfect. Tons of compliments from the toughest critics, so that’s a win.",this is a really pretty dress nicer than i expected i went with an xx based on reviews and the size chart at ’” this dress goes to my ankles because i’m shaped like an apple the dress is snug through the torso and a heavy shaper is required because the shape and color are lovely i’m going to buckle down swimlaps and cut the ice cream until i have a bit more room this is perfect for my summer eventsthere is zero stretch in this  rayon dress if you’re at all plus sized or big through the belly or breasts i’d recommend sizing upi thought the design on the green had a tiny bit of black on the design but the design is all brown super cuteupdatewith  days of limiting ice cream and wine and with the help of a solid shaper the dress was perfect tons of compliments from the toughest critics so that’s a win,1

"I ordered the polo in the fruit green/navy stripe variety, and while I get that computer monitors aren't always the perfect judge of color, mine usually is pretty close to reality. So, I have to report that the green striping on the actual shirt is far less subtle than it appears to be in the product page -- enough so that I doubt I'll wear this anywhere other than on a golf course, where my fashion standards (and everyone else's!) seem to be lower. The medium I ordered is true to size, the fabric has a nice feel to it, and it hangs well. I can see wearing it tucked or untucked. The stitchery looks pretty good, although I'm no expert. The product page shows a shirt with a crisp crease and a stand-up collar, but makes no claim to a reinforced collar. The actual collar isn't reinforced, and so I don't expect it'll be crisp and well creased for long. Care instructions and an extra button are sewn into the shirt. It says you can put it in a dryer, which not all wicking shirts claim. I'll still probably dry it on a line, but if I slip up and tumble dry it now and then, it's nice to know the manufacturer would have no objection. At just under thirty-three dollars, I'd say the price is about right. So, all in all, I'm happy to have it, and expect to walk many golf holes with it!",i ordered the polo in the fruit greennavy stripe variety and while i get that computer monitors arent always the perfect judge of color mine usually is pretty close to reality so i have to report that the green striping on the actual shirt is far less subtle than it appears to be in the product page  enough so that i doubt ill wear this anywhere other than on a golf course where my fashion standards and everyone elses seem to be lower the medium i ordered is true to size the fabric has a nice feel to it and it hangs well i can see wearing it tucked or untucked the stitchery looks pretty good although im no expert the product page shows a shirt with a crisp crease and a standup collar but makes no claim to a reinforced collar the actual collar isnt reinforced and so i dont expect itll be crisp and well creased for long care instructions and an extra button are sewn into the shirt it says you can put it in a dryer which not all wicking shirts claim ill still probably dry it on a line but if i slip up and tumble dry it now and then its nice to know the manufacturer would have no objection at just under thirtythree dollars id say the price is about right so all in all im happy to have it and expect to walk many golf holes with it,1

"This dress looks exactly like it does in the advertisement. There are some loose threads but it’s no big deal. The quality of the fabric is a bit thin, but it’s a perfect thickness for a summer dress, it’s not see through, and it’s a great length- long midi length. There is no lining underneath the dress, but it’s not see through, so it’s great! It’s a good deal for the price, very typical good summer dress. The color looks exactly as advertised and is nice.

"This jacket is one of my best purchases ever. I got recommended to it by my friend’s dad who had the same jacket (J-130) for over 25 years. I can tell why it held up for so long. This jacket is perfect for work in the cold or just for styling your outfits (I know you kind of people exist). The fabric this is made of is absolutely astounding and the stitching matches that as well. Along with that, there’s so many features that aren’t advertised on here like the inside zipper pockets and pen holder built into the right side hand pocket. The design of the cuffs allow for a perfect fit with any winter style/skiing glove. The part that absolutely sold me on this jacket was the zipper though. Typically Carhartt kind of misses on their zippers in my experience (especially with their backpacks and lunchboxes) but this one is very high quality. The one downside I can think of this jacket is the plastic aglets (the things on the end of the hood drawstring). Other than that, this jacket is perfect and 100% worth the $130 price tag.",this jacket is one of my best purchases ever i got recommended to it by my friend’s dad who had the same jacket j for over  years i can tell why it held up for so long this jacket is perfect for work in the cold or just for styling your outfits i know you kind of people exist the fabric this is made of is absolutely astounding and the stitching matches that as well along with that there’s so many features that aren’t advertised on here like the inside zipper pockets and pen holder built into the right side hand pocket the design of the cuffs allow for a perfect fit with any winter styleskiing glove the part that absolutely sold me on this jacket was the zipper though typically carhartt kind of misses on their zippers in my experience especially with their backpacks and lunchboxes but this one is very high quality the one downside i can think of this jacket is the plastic aglets the things on the end of the hood drawstring other than that this jacket is perfect and  worth the  price tag,1

"I am 62, weigh 225 pounds, and have a 34 waist and am very muscular, with muscular legs. These are the best fitting pants I own! The length is spectacular! They lay on top of my casual shoes and elegant sandals. They have terrific length! I am going to be having them dry cleaned, though they can be hand washed and hung dry, and ironed. I don't want to put the time and effort into this. I already have shirts that are dry cleaned, so I will add these to the mix. I bought 2 pair, brown and white, in order to test them out. I am now purchasing Black, Green, Navy Blue, and Dark Grey. The brown and white look terrific, with the colors natural, appearing as they should, and my wife really loves them as well, which is the most important test :) I purchased the large and I couldn't be more pleased with the fit! They don't ride up, when bending over, or sitting. They lay so nice on my hips, butt, and thighs, and are so cool and breezy, when it is warm. The look is very casual, but with a nice shirt will also pass as elegant for a nice night out! They are very well made, and the draw string is very functional.

"I absolutely love these shorts. It did, however, take me a few tries to get the right size. I have a 42 waist, so I first bought a size 42, because a lot of reviewers reported that these shorts are true to size. That was not my experience. So I ordered a size 40, and they were still falling off me. I tried one more time, ordering a size 38, and this is the size that fits my 42 waist. Go figure.They are great for the summer. The fabric is not too thick to be comfortable, and not too thin to be durable. The pockets are what really sold me on these, though, especially the phone pocket. It provides perfect access to my phone at all times, while keeping it out of the way during most activities.The front pockets are large, and deep, certainly large enough for any wallet you don't want to put in a back pocket or cargo pocket, as long as you don't mind the bulge it would make. The cargo pockets are great for wallets, as long as you don't need to access it much, because it takes two hands to open the Velcro opening and keep it from closing while you retrieve your wallet. Or at least it does, for me. A bit of a hassle.TL:DR - These are great shorts once you figure out their sizes relative to your measurements. They fit well after that, seem sturdy, and the pockets are great. Go for it, but be prepared to return for wrong size, or buy a few sizes and return what doesn't work.",i absolutely love these shorts it did however take me a few tries to get the right size i have a  waist so i first bought a size  because a lot of reviewers reported that these shorts are true to size that was not my experience so i ordered a size  and they were still falling off me i tried one more time ordering a size  and this is the size that fits my  waist go figurethey are great for the summer the fabric is not too thick to be comfortable and not too thin to be durable the pockets are what really sold me on these though especially the phone pocket it provides perfect access to my phone at all times while keeping it out of the way during most activitiesthe front pockets are large and deep certainly large enough for any wallet you dont want to put in a back pocket or cargo pocket as long as you dont mind the bulge it would make the cargo pockets are great for wallets as long as you dont need to access it much because it takes two hands to open the velcro opening and keep it from closing while you retrieve your wallet or at least it does for me a bit of a hassletldr  these are great shorts once you figure out their sizes relative to your measurements they fit well after that seem sturdy and the pockets are great go for it but be prepared to return for wrong size or buy a few sizes and return what doesnt work,1

"I caught these on sale for $25, which I was thrilled about.

"First off, these pants are exactly what I'd envisioned.  Very light but seem to be well built.  Seams seem good, no holes, I think they'll be as durable as you can expect a super light pair of dungarees to be.Sizing just for context:  I'm 6'4, about 220. I have a 35 inch inseam--can get by with 34--and 39 inch waist, I can usually use either 38 or 40 in normal men's sizes since there's no 39.  I bought the 2X and they fit almost perfectly, maybe just a smidge loose around the waist and hips but not bad at all, and I'd say about a 34 inch inseam.  They're fine although I could use them another inch longer, but they don't look like flood pants, just brush the top of my shoes enough to create a gentle break in the pant let above the shoe.However, I'm concerned about shrinkage when they're washed.  What I'm going to do is buy a pair of 3X, wash and dry them, and see what the end result is and I'll post those results.  But what I'd say is out of the package these have about a 40 inch waist and 34 inch inseam.",first off these pants are exactly what id envisioned  very light but seem to be well built  seams seem good no holes i think theyll be as durable as you can expect a super light pair of dungarees to besizing just for context  im  about  i have a  inch inseamcan get by with and  inch waist i can usually use either  or  in normal mens sizes since theres no   i bought the x and they fit almost perfectly maybe just a smidge loose around the waist and hips but not bad at all and id say about a  inch inseam  theyre fine although i could use them another inch longer but they dont look like flood pants just brush the top of my shoes enough to create a gentle break in the pant let above the shoehowever im concerned about shrinkage when theyre washed  what im going to do is buy a pair of x wash and dry them and see what the end result is and ill post those results  but what id say is out of the package these have about a  inch waist and  inch inseam,1

I don't really ride a ton of reviews but I just had to put it out there this shirt fits very well has a nice bit of stretchiness and in my opinion is a very flattering shirt. It's lightweight and very comfortable and I can tell from personal experience that this shirt will not stain easily LOL as I spilled some coffee on it earlier. I like the fit of this shirt so much that I ordered two more in different colors. The almost perfect rating that I'm giving it is only to say that the sleeves could be slightly shorter however they're perfect for the average person but I'm ultimately looking for a shirt that will showcase my arms a little bit better but this does an excellent job. It's really just a nitpick the shirt sits well above my elbow but if you're looking for a very tailored look this is almost perfect. I'm about 5'10 and  around 180 lbs and I ordered Medium so if you're around my height and weight this is going to be the perfect size for you. Amazon recommended that I get a large however I'm very glad I did not as this shirt fits perfect for my body type. Like I said just a slight nit pic that the sleeves could be shorter for maybe my arms as I don't have the longest arms out there by any means but if you have longer arms this shirt is really going to look nicely on you if you're fit. Now if your bit out of shape or whatever this shirt might show that off so it may not be the best idea for you however I imagine if you're buying under armor then you already know that you're looking for a shirt that's going to fit you as a fit person. I do have to mention that I got this on a 50% off sale but for $20 you're not going to find a better polo!,i dont really ride a ton of reviews but i just had to put it out there this shirt fits very well has a nice bit of stretchiness and in my opinion is a very flattering shirt its lightweight and very comfortable and i can tell from personal experience that this shirt will not stain easily lol as i spilled some coffee on it earlier i like the fit of this shirt so much that i ordered two more in different colors the almost perfect rating that im giving it is only to say that the sleeves could be slightly shorter however theyre perfect for the average person but im ultimately looking for a shirt that will showcase my arms a little bit better but this does an excellent job its really just a nitpick the shirt sits well above my elbow but if youre looking for a very tailored look this is almost perfect im about  and  around  lbs and i ordered medium so if youre around my height and weight this is going to be the perfect size for you amazon recommended that i get a large however im very glad i did not as this shirt fits perfect for my body type like i said just a slight nit pic that the sleeves could be shorter for maybe my arms as i dont have the longest arms out there by any means but if you have longer arms this shirt is really going to look nicely on you if youre fit now if your bit out of shape or whatever this shirt might show that off so it may not be the best idea for you however i imagine if youre buying under armor then you already know that youre looking for a shirt thats going to fit you as a fit person i do have to mention that i got this on a  off sale but for  youre not going to find a better polo,1

"If you are like me and for some  reason cannot wear polyester socks because they irritate your foot, this is the best your going to do for a quarter sock.  Cotton/Nylon I'm fine with, I'm pretty sure the 3% other fibers is polyester.  Lands End makes a quarter sock with cotton but they too added cheap polyester.  I kind of like these better as they are softer,  The socks listed as 100% are full of you know what,  What happened to go old cotton socks?  Costs.Are they comfortable, pretty much.  They are very soft.  I can't attest to durability at this time, talk to me in a year.  One of the questions was would I wear them to the gym, IDK, I still wear the Lands End and put these on after.

My favorite shoes I get an every 6 months they are my daily wear comfortable and very good looking! Comfortable is a must while being on my feet daily and these never hurt my feet. I normal wear a 11.5 but I go for the 12 in these for a little bit of room. They do run narrow but going a half size up helps with that.

"I was reading the Fruit (of the Loom) reviews and a reviewer mentioned that Gildan might be a better option. I bought the 6 pack of Fruit pocket T-Shirts assorted colors and a 2 pack of Gildan pocket T-Shirts navy blue. Both orders came in the same box. Fruit was in a factory labeled bag like you would buy in a store. Gildan was in an unlabeled plastic bag. Both sets XXL.Many reviewers noted that the Fruit colors were not exactly colorful. I received a light gray, charcoal gray, two dark blue and two black. Fine with me.I prefer a loose fitting T-Shirt. I don't like snug. I compared the sizes by placing a Gildan atop a Fruit. I noted that the Gildan was narrower around the middle than the Fruit. I also noted that the sleeves of the Fruit were shorter than the sleeves of the Gildan.I tried on each shirt. The Gildan was too snug for my liking. The Fruit had a looser fit and was more comfortable. Remember, both are XXL. This may not be an issue for you if you are not as big around the middle as I am.As to the weight of the T-Shirts I couldn't tell the difference, although they were a lighter weight than my old Russell T-Shirts.I took one Fruit and one Gildan and put them in the wash to test for shrinkage, figuring if they were going to shrink, best to get it over with. Setting for the wash was warm, setting for the dry was medium.Both shirts shrunk, but only vertically by about a half inch. They did not shrink around the middle. Fruit was still a loose fit, Gildan snug.After the wash, the Gildan fabric felt a little rough to the touch. That was disturbing. The Fruit's fabric felt soft - very nice.The 6 pack of Fruit cost $19.98 ($3.38 each). The 2 pack of Gildan cost $13.99 ($6.995 each). Neither breaks the bank but, hey, one's gotta love a bargain.I'm not taking points off for the shrinkage. Apparently, all T-Shirts shrink in the wash, unless you can find pre-shrunk T-Shirts that don't. One can only hope they don't keep shrinking after many washings.Fruit gets 5 stars. Gildan gets 4 because of the fit and the rough feel of the fabric post-wash. I'm returning the Gildan and ordering another pack of the Fruit.",i was reading the fruit of the loom reviews and a reviewer mentioned that gildan might be a better option i bought the  pack of fruit pocket tshirts assorted colors and a  pack of gildan pocket tshirts navy blue both orders came in the same box fruit was in a factory labeled bag like you would buy in a store gildan was in an unlabeled plastic bag both sets xxlmany reviewers noted that the fruit colors were not exactly colorful i received a light gray charcoal gray two dark blue and two black fine with mei prefer a loose fitting tshirt i dont like snug i compared the sizes by placing a gildan atop a fruit i noted that the gildan was narrower around the middle than the fruit i also noted that the sleeves of the fruit were shorter than the sleeves of the gildani tried on each shirt the gildan was too snug for my liking the fruit had a looser fit and was more comfortable remember both are xxl this may not be an issue for you if you are not as big around the middle as i amas to the weight of the tshirts i couldnt tell the difference although they were a lighter weight than my old russell tshirtsi took one fruit and one gildan and put them in the wash to test for shrinkage figuring if they were going to shrink best to get it over with setting for the wash was warm setting for the dry was mediumboth shirts shrunk but only vertically by about a half inch they did not shrink around the middle fruit was still a loose fit gildan snugafter the wash the gildan fabric felt a little rough to the touch that was disturbing the fruits fabric felt soft  very nicethe  pack of fruit cost   each the  pack of gildan cost   each neither breaks the bank but hey ones gotta love a bargainim not taking points off for the shrinkage apparently all tshirts shrink in the wash unless you can find preshrunk tshirts that dont one can only hope they dont keep shrinking after many washingsfruit gets  stars gildan gets  because of the fit and the rough feel of the fabric postwash im returning the gildan and ordering another pack of the fruit,1
"I work at least 40 hours a week entirely on my feet in a restaurant and I've had these about 2 weeks now and I'm impressed.  Fit is perfect and they're very comfortable even for double shifts on my feet all day.  I prefer this kind of support which is more flat versus running shoe type support.  This feels more natural to me and I'm better balanced.  Definitely waterproof and not bad looking.The real test will come after nightly exposure to the harsh floor cleaning chemicals we use that always ate up my previous work shoes and separated the soles from the tops.  I will try to update this review in a couple of months after I see how they hold up.  But so far, so good.  Definitely a great value for high quality work shoes.",i work at least  hours a week entirely on my feet in a restaurant and ive had these about  weeks now and im impressed  fit is perfect and theyre very comfortable even for double shifts on my feet all day  i prefer this kind of support which is more flat versus running shoe type support  this feels more natural to me and im better balanced  definitely waterproof and not bad lookingthe real test will come after nightly exposure to the harsh floor cleaning chemicals we use that always ate up my previous work shoes and separated the soles from the tops  i will try to update this review in a couple of months after i see how they hold up  but so far so good  definitely a great value for high quality work shoes,1
"As someone who has worn Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans in both regular and big & tall sizes, I can confidently say that these pants are the perfect combination of style, comfort, and versatility. They're like the Swiss Army Knife of pants – you can wear them to work, to a fancy dinner, or even to a punk rock concert.Let's start with the fit. The 511s are slim, but not too skinny. They hug your legs in all the right places without making you look like you're trying too hard. And because they come in both regular and big & tall sizes, there's a pair for every body type. No more squeezing into pants that are too tight or drowning in pants that are too loose!But it's not just the fit that makes these jeans so great. It's the little details, like the iconic Levi's logo on the back pocket and the sturdy denim material that holds up to wear and tear. And let's not forget about the button fly – it's like a fun little puzzle every time you put them on!Of course, the best part about these jeans is how versatile they are. I've worn them to a fancy dinner with a blazer and dress shoes, and I've also worn them to a punk rock concert with a t-shirt and Converse sneakers. They're like a chameleon – they can adapt to any situation!Now, I know what you're thinking – But are they comfortable? The answer is a resounding yes! The denim is soft and breathable, so you don't feel like you're suffocating in your pants. And because they're slim, you don't have to worry about excess fabric bunching up and causing discomfort.In conclusion, if you're looking for a pair of pants that are stylish, comfortable, and versatile, look no further than Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans. They're the Swiss Army Knife of pants, and they'll quickly become your go-to for any occasion. And let's be real – who doesn't want to be a little bit like a Swiss Army Knife? I give them 4 out of 5 stars only because they could be a bit pricier than some other options out there, but they are well worth it.Let's compare them with the Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans.1. Fit: Both Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans and Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans are designed to fit slim and tapered through the leg. However, the Levi's 511 Slim Fit Jeans have a slightly more relaxed fit around the thighs and calves, while the Calvin Klein Skinny Fit Jeans have a tighter, more streamlined fit throughout the leg.2. Material: The Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans are made from a blend of cotton and elastane, giving them a soft and comfortable feel with a bit of stretch for added mobility. The Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans are made from 98% cotton and 2% elastane, providing a similar level of comfort and stretch.3. Style: The Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans have a classic five-pocket design and come in a range of washes, from dark indigo to light blue. They also feature Levi's signature arcuate stitching on the back pockets. The Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans have a similar five-pocket design but with a more minimalist look, with no visible branding or stitching.4. Price: The Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans typically cost around $70 to $80, while the Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans usually range from $50 to $70, making them a more affordable option.5. Overall, both jeans are great options for anyone looking for a slim and tapered fit. The Levi's Men's 511 Slim Fit Jeans offer a slightly more relaxed fit, while the Calvin Klein Men's Skinny Fit Jeans provide a more streamlined look.

On my order for the second pair, this blue, I ordered 36 and they are very consistent with the first pair. Sizing is subjective to feel and body type so I hope this helps.

"Excellent quality as always.One beef:  How can two pair of Carhartt pants, both with the same waist size, have two very different lengths/circumferences?  After wearing the same size canvas work pants from Carhartt, I ordered these jeans in the same size, only to discover that the jeans had a waist that was almost 2 inches larger than the canvas pants.  And no, it's not due to washing/shrinking.  New canvas, old canvas were the same, but the jeans were much larger.The reason we have standard units of measure is so that we can all agree on things like length, weight, volume, etc.  Two pairs of pants from the same manufacturer, in the same size, should NOT be so very different.Otherwise, Carhartt is one of the finest clothiers I've ever patronized.",excellent quality as alwaysone beef  how can two pair of carhartt pants both with the same waist size have two very different lengthscircumferences  after wearing the same size canvas work pants from carhartt i ordered these jeans in the same size only to discover that the jeans had a waist that was almost  inches larger than the canvas pants  and no its not due to washingshrinking  new canvas old canvas were the same but the jeans were much largerthe reason we have standard units of measure is so that we can all agree on things like length weight volume etc  two pairs of pants from the same manufacturer in the same size should not be so very differentotherwise carhartt is one of the finest clothiers ive ever patronized,1

"I have bought several of these over the past few years and as with anything there is the good, the bad and the ugly. The Good - These are probably the most comfortable pants you will ever wear. The material is light and soft. They look very good as well I wear with Polo shirts and T shirts. THE BAD - While I love draw stings I don't love these drawstrings. What they do is take a length of string and bring the ends together in the back of the pants and sew the ends down. The problem is sometimes they don't get them sewed down very good at all. Some will come loose in the back and when it does it is almost impossible to get the string threaded back through the waist band. THE UGLY - While these are the most comfortable pants you will ever wear they are not durable. Granted the will NOT ball up but if you have to do anything where you are actually working they will wear, snag easily. These pants are very delicate and as long as you are doing no work they will be fine as long as the drawstrings stay sewed.",i have bought several of these over the past few years and as with anything there is the good the bad and the ugly the good  these are probably the most comfortable pants you will ever wear the material is light and soft they look very good as well i wear with polo shirts and t shirts the bad  while i love draw stings i dont love these drawstrings what they do is take a length of string and bring the ends together in the back of the pants and sew the ends down the problem is sometimes they dont get them sewed down very good at all some will come loose in the back and when it does it is almost impossible to get the string threaded back through the waist band the ugly  while these are the most comfortable pants you will ever wear they are not durable granted the will not ball up but if you have to do anything where you are actually working they will wear snag easily these pants are very delicate and as long as you are doing no work they will be fine as long as the drawstrings stay sewed,1

"I first bought the green pair that is in the different hues of green and I absolutely fell in love with these shoes. The comfort, fit, and the styles are out of this world. So, what did I do? I ended up returning to buy a pair in every single color. I added some pictures of the pairs that I do have, but I still couldn't quite fit them all in. I get compliments on them everywhere I go. And what REALLY sold me on this company even more was that my pink pair  of shoes were running pretty late, so I contacted the company, and Green told me how sorry they were and offered for me to keep the shoes when they arrived and offered a full refund too. After I thought about it, I contacted them again, and asked them to please not refund me and to please keep THEIR money because they are a small business who makes a great quality item which I love, and I would feel badly to keep the shoes when they arrived and their money. They thanked me, and then told me they would send me a gift of some of their new designs. I gave them my address, but honestly did not expect anything. And wouldn't you know it, after I had forgotten all about it, they DID, in fact  send me 3 new pairs of their brand new color/designs. I was beyond touched. I am a total shoe nut and even a sneakerhead, so I had to buy a new hanging shoe closet JUST for THEIR shoes, and it still doesn't hold them all. I absolutely love their shoes, and I love them even more as a company. To anyone reading this please do not take advantage of their kindness. They are truly wonderful people who deserve every penny they charge which is more than a fair price, for these fantastic, comfortable, chic, shoes. I will be a customer for life. I would've wrote this review sooner, but I didn't want all the colors I didn't have yet, to run out before I got my hands on them. Selfish? Maybe, but they are JUST TOO GOOD.

"These jeans were not bad overall but not the quality I have come to expect in Lees.Would I buy them again?..I think so and here’s why. First they are comfortable and the waist/length size is true. They are extremely lightweight so if you are in a hot climate (like TX) then these pants can be worn longer into the warm season than regular full denim. On the opposite side of the coin if you live in a very cold climate steer away from these.Two things that bothered me a little bit. One is the color- these are NOT traditional solid “blue” jean. There’s hundreds of different lighter shaded blue strands woven throughout giving the pants an almost striped look. Second I find them to be very baggy along the rear calf from butt to back of knee. It makes them, as mentioned, comfortable but not real stylish. Now the pants might shrink a bit after washing but as I haven’t done that yet I don’t know if that’s going to happen.For the cost it can be considered an acceptable purchase.",these jeans were not bad overall but not the quality i have come to expect in leeswould i buy them againi think so and here’s why first they are comfortable and the waistlength size is true they are extremely lightweight so if you are in a hot climate like tx then these pants can be worn longer into the warm season than regular full denim on the opposite side of the coin if you live in a very cold climate steer away from thesetwo things that bothered me a little bit one is the color these are not traditional solid “blue” jean there’s hundreds of different lighter shaded blue strands woven throughout giving the pants an almost striped look second i find them to be very baggy along the rear calf from butt to back of knee it makes them as mentioned comfortable but not real stylish now the pants might shrink a bit after washing but as i haven’t done that yet i don’t know if that’s going to happenfor the cost it can be considered an acceptable purchase,1

The fabric allows air to circulate easily, keeping you cool even during sweaty and strenuous exercises. The relaxed fit doesn’t restrict movement, making it perfect for dynamic sports or activities that require full range of motion.---#### DurabilityUnder Armour’s reputation for durability holds up with the **Tech 2.0 T-shirt**. Despite being incredibly soft, the shirt feels sturdy and holds up well against frequent washing. Even after regular workouts and wash cycles, the shirt retains its shape and texture without pilling or fading.---#### Fit and SizingThe **Tech 2.0** offers a **loose fit** which is ideal for athletes who prefer a little more room or anyone who wants a casual, non-restrictive feel.

It performs well during workouts, providing moisture control and breathability, while its versatile fit makes it wearable for more casual occasions.

"I usually just take the loss on things like this and move on, but I felt compelled to write a review of these boxers since I just purchased 2 packs and already they are ripping on me. Now, I am not a big guy. I wear a 32 waist size, which would put me at the smaller end of this size boxer (size indicated 32-34). That being said, when I tried these on upon opening them (before any wash cycles) they were way too snug against my body, everywhere except the waistband. They are so snug in fact, that the fly is stretched wide open exposing my privates. And forget about spreading my legs comfortably. Oh well I'll just bite the bullet and wear them until they inevitably tear, I thought. I knew not to wash them in warm water or put them in the dryer. Instead I let them hang dry. When I went to wear them again, they were even tighter, and I found them tearing after only a single wash/wear. And I'm not doing the splits or any high kicking. And thank God they are worn underneath pants, because otherwise it would be pretty embarrassing. With any moderate activity, they almost rip right in half. Crotch, backside, it's a roll of the dice. I hope this review will help prevent anyone else buying these totally garbage boxers. I just wish I hadn't purchased two. Even my older Hanes with the exposed elastic band are WAY more comfortable, AND the right fit. 0/10 these suck I wish I could get a refund.",i usually just take the loss on things like this and move on but i felt compelled to write a review of these boxers since i just purchased  packs and already they are ripping on me now i am not a big guy i wear a  waist size which would put me at the smaller end of this size boxer size indicated  that being said when i tried these on upon opening them before any wash cycles they were way too snug against my body everywhere except the waistband they are so snug in fact that the fly is stretched wide open exposing my privates and forget about spreading my legs comfortably oh well ill just bite the bullet and wear them until they inevitably tear i thought i knew not to wash them in warm water or put them in the dryer instead i let them hang dry when i went to wear them again they were even tighter and i found them tearing after only a single washwear and im not doing the splits or any high kicking and thank god they are worn underneath pants because otherwise it would be pretty embarrassing with any moderate activity they almost rip right in half crotch backside its a roll of the dice i hope this review will help prevent anyone else buying these totally garbage boxers i just wish i hadnt purchased two even my older hanes with the exposed elastic band are way more comfortable and the right fit  these suck i wish i could get a refund,0

"This item does not fit like what is pictures, which seems to be a common trend when it comes to these Asian branded clothes. Yes, of course I'm not oblivious and realize most clothing does come from china/vietnam etc, what I'm talking about is specifically Asian Branded and imported clothing not subsided asian made with a GAP tag on it. These typically are cheaper, the same quality as your Mall Brands, sometimes even better. I have had hit or miss success with the clothing and this one was unfortunately a miss. As far as look, it was pretty much spot on, color and style wise. But the fit was way off.I'm 5'10, 180lb with an athletic / bodybuilder body type, so I typically need something that fits snug / comfortable but with the length for a longer torso. I bought a small in this, thinking hopefully it fit the upper body the way I want with the length as to not become a mid-drift / short fit. This hit the mark on length for the most part, but the fit was baggy. It's not slim fit or athletic fit at all, very baggy with a weird excess in fabric on the back where it almost tented out. Depending on what kind of look or fit your going for, maybe this will work if you tend to be on the bigger side or don't mind your clothes fitting pretty loose.Like I said, the material seemed decent and the look was great, but the fit was just not what I expected when you look on how they modeled / pictured it.",this item does not fit like what is pictures which seems to be a common trend when it comes to these asian branded clothes yes of course im not oblivious and realize most clothing does come from chinavietnam etc what im talking about is specifically asian branded and imported clothing not subsided asian made with a gap tag on it these typically are cheaper the same quality as your mall brands sometimes even better i have had hit or miss success with the clothing and this one was unfortunately a miss as far as look it was pretty much spot on color and style wise but the fit was way offim  lb with an athletic  bodybuilder body type so i typically need something that fits snug  comfortable but with the length for a longer torso i bought a small in this thinking hopefully it fit the upper body the way i want with the length as to not become a middrift  short fit this hit the mark on length for the most part but the fit was baggy its not slim fit or athletic fit at all very baggy with a weird excess in fabric on the back where it almost tented out depending on what kind of look or fit your going for maybe this will work if you tend to be on the bigger side or dont mind your clothes fitting pretty looselike i said the material seemed decent and the look was great but the fit was just not what i expected when you look on how they modeled  pictured it,0

"I've been buying Polo socks since the '80s. I've tried numerous other brands and frankly, only Polo -- at least for casual wear -- works for me. I have pairs that I have had for 2 decades. They have shrunk and nowhere near as comfortable as they once were, but they aren't worn and are still wearable. As with anything else Polo, if you can avoid the shrinkage, you've got a good product to wear almost indefinitely. They either stay with the same factories that produce their goods or they keep good controls over the factories they use, unlike other brands. The only real issue with Polo can be price and or value, but these socks were well worth it.I also have a set of black socks that are essentially the same. I wear them with my dress pants and shoes. They are a little thick but are very comfortable. I have all but quit wearing anything higher than quarter socks. My pants do not ride up on my leg so quarter socks do not show and take less time to put on (not a huge deal but if I'm running late...).The one thing I must caution everyone with respect to ANY quality clothing, but ESPECIALLY RL Polo: wash on COLD on Delicate (with a light detergent like Woolite) and then dry on VERY low heat (delicate setting if you have it). If they aren't quite dry, finish the cycle on air dry if you have that setting. Never run these clothes on any hot water or anything but the lowest heat setting in your dryer for as short a period of time as possible. Trust me on this. I have clothing from 20+ years ago that I still wear that has been washed and dried at home. I dry clean some things and a lot of people get their laundry done but it is unlikely you'll do that to these socks. If you throw them in the washer on hot and high heat in the dryer, you'll be lucky to get 6 months out of them.

"Grew up wearing real Levis, then had to quit when they got so danged expensive around the '80s or so.  I'd still spring for a pair now and again but not in at least the last 20 years.

I live a rugged life-style and Levi's have always held up the best.  I have no butt and bird legs, but I still like pants to not sag on me, even though they may be my size.  These are just a tad loose but they still feel great and the length is spot on.  The price was not too bad, either.  One thing I noticed was that, depending on the selection, the prices do fluctuate so be sure to do a little exploring if you decide to buy these.  I caught on by changing the colors but some smaller sizes were less expensive as well.  Mix and match and find the right price.

"This is a cute shoe, the quality is there, this the 4 stars, but it is stiff and small sizing; this, not 5 stars.Having read reviews prior to ordering, I ordered half-size larger especially since I wanted to wear socks with them when it's cold. That won't happenen.They are snug without socks. Sadface. My fit tends to be wide and that is true with this fit, they are sized correctly for B width, but I was hoping this half- size larger might accommodate that too. It does not. For me, they are tight in the width. And the extra half-size results in making them a bit too long in the length.All that said,  now I know how Tom's fit me... so that is a good thing. The stiffness could have been lived with while wearing socks thinking that as they broke in perhaps they would loosen up. But, as is, the stiffness isn't comfortable.Also, one of the reviewers was suprized there was a fuzzy lining... mine does not have a fuzzy lining...UPDATE: momma loved them! The half size larger worked perfectly!! She doesn't think they are stiff as I do. The color variation goes great with many outfits of blue, brown, gray, pink, jeans...awesome!",this is a cute shoe the quality is there this the  stars but it is stiff and small sizing this not  starshaving read reviews prior to ordering i ordered halfsize larger especially since i wanted to wear socks with them when its cold that wont happenenthey are snug without socks sadface my fit tends to be wide and that is true with this fit they are sized correctly for b width but i was hoping this half size larger might accommodate that too it does not for me they are tight in the width and the extra halfsize results in making them a bit too long in the lengthall that said  now i know how toms fit me so that is a good thing the stiffness could have been lived with while wearing socks thinking that as they broke in perhaps they would loosen up but as is the stiffness isnt comfortablealso one of the reviewers was suprized there was a fuzzy lining mine does not have a fuzzy liningupdate momma loved them the half size larger worked perfectly she doesnt think they are stiff as i do the color variation goes great with many outfits of blue brown gray pink jeansawesome,1

"I use these treadmill and lifting weights.  I use my Asics for squats and these for upper body workouts.  Theses are like my Nike Cortez's except they have a leather tongue instead of Nike's stupid nylon one.  The leather tongue is very luxurious and puts Nike to shame which makes me sad because I like Nike.  I wear these with Puma shirts as to match and so far okay but they need dark navy Puma logos instead of off blues and sissy girl colors like candy or windows 8 start menu.I used to like Puma Suede's but last pair hurt my feet after walking on sidewalks for long amounts of time.  I am not sure why that happened.  Seemed weird like they used to be more comfortable.  Maybe I got a bad pair.Had/have a pair of Puma Dallas I never wear because they are too loose in the width and about 1/2 or more too long.  They slip off the heel when running no matter how tight I lace them (which makes them look long and too skinny and just funny) and they wiggle when I squat which is dangerous and annoying.  The low heel is nice but who cares if it wiggles, how can I lift confidently with wiggle?Puma whirlwind had stupid nubby outsole which looked like dumb golf cleats and worse hurt my feet when I was walking to the mall and in the mall.  On hard surfaces the nubs make a funny noise and people stared at me obviously amused by my choice of footwear.  They click clacked on the hard tile so not good choice for out and about activities.  Maybe sprinting on clay track or grass turf.  Stay off concrete/asphalt/indoor surfaces.The G. Villas seem nice tennis shoe comparable to my Kswiss Classics so I might try them but I do not need tennis shoes right now.  If I did I would rather G Unit Reebox's.The speed cats piqued my interest some time ago but I was not sure if the sleek styling was suitable for casual wear, too European.  I could definitely see the value as sports trainers am I really liked when the outsole was good year rubber tire inspired.  Kind of like racing car slicker tires i.e. less tread more traction.  Now I am into working out more so these would be more appropriate for me as long as I did not combine the with no show socks as is a current trend.  I need coverage on my Achilles plus like wearing Nike quarter crews so you can SEE the logo.  No show's have logo on bottom of sock wear you can not see it, how stupid is that.All in all these are probably the best puma I have had not to low like the speed cats which would have to be purely sports trainers.  I can wear these with jeans and look cool like they are Adidas superstars or something.  Low shoes look bad with jeans unless you are bisexual and wear tight jeans or something.  I wear looser jeans so low shoes tend to be paired training shorts.  I can bench press with loose jeans and look normal.So these worked for the money , look good for casual, knocked off the Asics Corsair's/Nike Cortez but as least incorporated a leather tongue which should be almost mandatory, and are okay for sports and training.  Not hardcore running or atg squats but bench pressing, leg pressing, light track work etc.Update 8/9/2019:I just received a white with black stripe. They are not as good as the originals. They are lighter and cheap naugahyde. They had a scratch on one and the other was crushed. They are comfortable but not the quality I expect from a german brand.

"Let’s start with what I love….the color is beautiful and it fits true to size. I’m 5’4, 38B cup & 140 pounds.  I have a lot of saggy fat in my stomach. Tbh, I could pass as a pregnant woman. This is probably the 20th dress I’ve ordered this month looking for different options to wear to a wedding, shower and rehearsal. Most of the dresses with the leg slit are more immodest than what I like, so those have all gone back.  This slit hits my calf, even when I sit in doesn’t ride up and show off the lady parts. It’s not so sheer that a slip is required and it hides my gut so well I won’t have to wear any slimming tank or body suit underneath. The only negative, the snap is just not placed well. I wear a Warner bra from Kohls. It’s the only brand bra I can wear that doesn’t push my under arm fat up uncomfortably. It smooths the back fat. I have a few, with and without underwire and Extra padding. But with a 38 B cup most dresses, even when paired with a bra with no padding or underwire, typically is tight in the bust. This dress gives plenty of bust room but again; the snap hits in the wrong area. It causes a gape in the material that looks awkward and ill fitting. Thankfully my mother in law was able to remove the snap easily and just do a bit of hand sewing to tack the dress In a more flattering spot right above the bra line. My video shows the snap undone with a pin tacking it together where she will sew it shut. If you have a 38B cup and don’t have anyone that can alter this dress it may not work for you. If your really small busted than I’d say go for it, as the spot the snap sits would be fine for you. If your really large busted I’d also say the snap would work since your filling this entire area with boob and there won’t be a gape in the dress like it did for me. I will definitely be ordering another color, most likely the yellow flor, because the quality of this dress is great. This coming from someone who has tried on over 30 dresses from Amazon in the last 2 weeks and knows what’s crap vs. quality.

"Really good pair of pants... I had to shrink them on purpose to get a more fitted look though... But they are very nice pants for the price... They are low rise so I liked that...

Nice thickness on the denim, not like thin cheap Chinese jeans... Very comfortable... I would compare it to a Levis 511 unwashed...

I absolutely love this blouse and Iâ€™ve gotten compliments wearing it. The material is great quality and soft and well made. It fits really nice.

My first pair (work) lasted about a year, but I am very hard on them, I'd expect if they were worn casually they'd last much much longer . Easy to put on and very breathable.

"I bought these shirts because I needed shirts for my daily workouts at the gym. The price was low enough to take a chance, and it turns out these are now my go to for the gym.

"I got these shoes because I needed more support and stability than the running shoes I've been buying/wearing for years, and they're great for that.  They feel durable and should last a long time.  Unfortunately though the insoles are ok but not great and after just a week I already had to adjust the insole shape with athletic tape because the shoe inside wasn't perfectly flat.  A high quality insole might be required to make these shoes fit as they should, simply because the foot bed isn't totally flat.  I usually wear normal width shoes too, but the fore-foot for the normal width was much too narrow so I had to go to the wide size.  The wide size is fine in the forefoot but a bit too wide in the heel, so again I'm having to adjust the shoe to get it to feel right.  They're better for walking than most other shoes I've tried recently though, so it's worth it to keep working on the insole to get a better fit.",i got these shoes because i needed more support and stability than the running shoes ive been buyingwearing for years and theyre great for that  they feel durable and should last a long time  unfortunately though the insoles are ok but not great and after just a week i already had to adjust the insole shape with athletic tape because the shoe inside wasnt perfectly flat  a high quality insole might be required to make these shoes fit as they should simply because the foot bed isnt totally flat  i usually wear normal width shoes too but the forefoot for the normal width was much too narrow so i had to go to the wide size  the wide size is fine in the forefoot but a bit too wide in the heel so again im having to adjust the shoe to get it to feel right  theyre better for walking than most other shoes ive tried recently though so its worth it to keep working on the insole to get a better fit,1

"I’ve been playing basketball for a long time, and finding the right pair of shorts that are comfortable and functional can be a bit of a challenge. After hearing some good things about these basketball shorts, I decided to give them a try. Here’s what I’ve found after wearing them for a few days.Comfort and Fit:The first thing I noticed when I put these shorts on was how lightweight they are. They don’t feel bulky at all, which is really important when you’re running up and down the court. The material feels breathable, and it’s great for wicking away sweat. Even after a really intense game, I didn’t feel like I was carrying around a bunch of soaked fabric.As for the fit, they run true to size. I’m 6'0 and I went with a large, and they fit perfectly. Not too tight around the waist or thighs, but not baggy either. The waistband has a nice elastic feel that keeps them in place without feeling constricting. I’ve worn them through a few pick-up games, and I didn’t have to keep adjusting them, which is always a plus.Performance on the Court:When I’m playing, I need something that won’t restrict my movement, and these shorts do a great job. Whether I’m driving to the basket, playing defense, or just shooting around, the shorts don’t ride up or get in the way. The length is perfect, hitting just above the knee, which gives me plenty of mobility without feeling like I’m showing too much leg. The side slits at the bottom help with flexibility, allowing for more freedom when I’m making quick moves or pivots.They also do a good job of keeping me cool. I’m someone who sweats a lot when I play, and I was happy to find that the material breathes really well, helping to keep me comfortable during longer sessions. I didn’t notice any chafing or discomfort around the thighs, even after a few hours of wear.Durability:After using them regularly for a few weeks, I’m happy to say they’ve held up really well. I’ve washed them several times, and they’ve kept their shape, with no signs of wear or fraying. The stitching is solid, and the fabric hasn’t pilled or lost its stretch. I’m usually pretty rough on my basketball gear, so the fact that these shorts still look and feel brand new is a big plus.Aesthetics:These shorts have a simple, clean design. I got the black pair, which has a subtle logo on the side. I like the minimalist look; it’s not too flashy but still looks good. They come in a variety of colors, so you can easily find something that matches your style or team colors. The overall design is modern, and they fit the aesthetic I like when I’m on the court.The Downsides:One minor downside is that while the shorts are very comfortable, they could use a little more storage. There are no pockets, which is fine for playing, but it would be nice to have a small, hidden pocket for things like keys or a phone if you’re wearing them outside of practice. It’s not a huge issue for me because I mainly wear them just to play, but if you like having a pocket option, these shorts don’t offer that.Also, the fabric is super breathable, which is great for playing, but I noticed that in colder weather, they don’t offer much warmth. If you’re playing outside in cooler temperatures, you might need to layer up underneath or wear something else on top. But, for hot weather or indoor games, these shorts are perfect.Conclusion:Overall, I’m really happy with these basketball shorts. They’re comfortable, breathable, and perform well on the court. The fit is spot on, and they’re durable enough to handle regular use. If you’re looking for a pair of shorts to wear during your basketball games or practices, I’d definitely recommend these. However, if you need pockets or play in colder conditions, this might not be your best bet.Would I recommend them? Absolutely!

"It's harder than you think to find socks with actual COTTON that aren't the premium brands $$. My two boys now wear adult size shoes & socks.

These ran large on me right out of the package and I was careful to order by my measurements. The back pocket placement is weirdly low. Not sure if this is due to the yoke on the back of the waist or not. I like the Madison color. Will order a size 10 and return whichever is the poorest fit. The average length was perfect for my 5'8 height and the quality is good overall.,these ran large on me right out of the package and i was careful to order by my measurements the back pocket placement is weirdly low not sure if this is due to the yoke on the back of the waist or not i like the madison color will order a size  and return whichever is the poorest fit the average length was perfect for my  height and the quality is good overall,1
"Love these. They stay in place on my thigh. Colors don’t fade. Price is reasonable.

"These shoes are being promoted as anti-plantar fasciitis but they don't work as advertised because they need better insoles. I used them as they came and the results were not that good but as soon as I paired them with good insoles, the results were outstanding. Don't get me wrong, the shoes are great for the money and the features work well. I work in a bar and the anti-slip and waterproof features are similar to more expensive brands. They are not too light or heavy, and they fit as expected. I got a wide variety and they are roomy and comfortable.The construction is strong but the anti-slip sole seems to be glued together to the bottom of the shoe, and in my experience, they tend to come unglued after some use.

"Didn't buy a lot of newborn clothes for my son, because I figured he'd grown out of them quickly. Well, he didn't grow super fast, and I needed some clothes that fit him while he was little, but would fit for a while. I'm used to the Carter clothes running small, so I was pleasantly surprised at these. They fit him at 1 month old, and he can still fit into them at 5 months old (and 14.5ish pounds). Super cute variety, and for all snaps, they aren't too bad to get on and take off.

"Excellent! There is a reason why the Samba is a classic for this many years. Originally only a true athletic gear, today a well respected piece of fashion item in your closet. Many, myself included have seen its durability and versatility with time. Honestly it is surprising how reasonably price it still is. Now, let's talk about its downsides - the insole is not durable and is quite thin, definitely not great if you have low arches and need support. This can be remedied by removing the insole it came with and replace it with an arch support insole. The tongue is stiff and even painful on the ankle, so it does require a breaking in period to soften. Honestly, Sambas are fantastic at this price point, a combination of fashion meets function.",excellent there is a reason why the samba is a classic for this many years originally only a true athletic gear today a well respected piece of fashion item in your closet many myself included have seen its durability and versatility with time honestly it is surprising how reasonably price it still is now lets talk about its downsides  the insole is not durable and is quite thin definitely not great if you have low arches and need support this can be remedied by removing the insole it came with and replace it with an arch support insole the tongue is stiff and even painful on the ankle so it does require a breaking in period to soften honestly sambas are fantastic at this price point a combination of fashion meets function,1
"Overall I love these joggers. They’re very comfy and warm, but not too warm and the stretch in the fabric is amazing, plus they don’t feel particularly heavy. The only issue I have with these is the pockets that are sewn in by the zipper. In theory, zipper pockets are great, but after a while the thread holding the pocket to the pant begins to loosen and now I’ve got a hole on the top part of the pockets on both sides. I’ve had these for about 7 months now, and three months in I stopped using the pocket zippers because I noticed it was getting loose. Even after I stopped using the zipper, when you pull your pants up or if you put your phone in there, it pulls on the thread and I ended up getting a hole along the pocket lining. Luckily I can just sew them back on, but not everyone has the capacity or ability to do that. I would still recommend getting these because they are super comfy and relatively light-weight especially if you’re just wearing them around the house. Just be mindful of the pockets.",overall i love these joggers they’re very comfy and warm but not too warm and the stretch in the fabric is amazing plus they don’t feel particularly heavy the only issue i have with these is the pockets that are sewn in by the zipper in theory zipper pockets are great but after a while the thread holding the pocket to the pant begins to loosen and now i’ve got a hole on the top part of the pockets on both sides i’ve had these for about  months now and three months in i stopped using the pocket zippers because i noticed it was getting loose even after i stopped using the zipper when you pull your pants up or if you put your phone in there it pulls on the thread and i ended up getting a hole along the pocket lining luckily i can just sew them back on but not everyone has the capacity or ability to do that i would still recommend getting these because they are super comfy and relatively lightweight especially if you’re just wearing them around the house just be mindful of the pockets,1

"This jacket seemed incredibly solid, well-made, had very warm insulation & I was able to walk outside to test it out, & I could not feel any cold whatsoever, so it does the job effectively.Taking off a star because while the measurement chart is accurate in chest/bust, it is extremely tight in the shoulders in my instance, which prohibits full range of motion.

"I was a bit hesitant about purchasing this dress online, especially when it comes to sizing. I’m 5 feet tall, 160 pounds with a bit of a gut, and I really didn’t want to end up looking like a round blob or have my boobs spilling out. I also wanted to find something that would cover my arms and stomach because I’m not a fan of showing those areas. This dress turned out to be exactly what I was hoping for! It fit perfectly and had the flowy sleeves I was looking for, offering great coverage without feeling bulky.The length was perfect for my height—just grazing the top of my feet when I wore wedges. If it’s a little long for you with wedges, the waist is constructed in a way that you can pull it up slightly to shorten the dress a tad more. The dress is a beautiful pink color, and I received lots of compliments throughout the day, which made me feel so pretty.One thing I wasn’t thrilled about was that the bottom was a bit sheer, with a slit that exposed more than I was comfortable with, especially since I have spider veins and prefer to keep my legs covered. I had no trouble taking it to my local seamstress, and for just $7, she sealed up the slit for me, which was an easy fix.The dress does come with a built-in slip, but I added a shorter slip underneath to avoid a Princess Di moment—especially since it was an outdoor wedding...just in case. Overall, this dress was the perfect choice for me. I felt confident, comfortable, and, most importantly, pretty!",i was a bit hesitant about purchasing this dress online especially when it comes to sizing i’m  feet tall  pounds with a bit of a gut and i really didn’t want to end up looking like a round blob or have my boobs spilling out i also wanted to find something that would cover my arms and stomach because i’m not a fan of showing those areas this dress turned out to be exactly what i was hoping for it fit perfectly and had the flowy sleeves i was looking for offering great coverage without feeling bulkythe length was perfect for my height—just grazing the top of my feet when i wore wedges if it’s a little long for you with wedges the waist is constructed in a way that you can pull it up slightly to shorten the dress a tad more the dress is a beautiful pink color and i received lots of compliments throughout the day which made me feel so prettyone thing i wasn’t thrilled about was that the bottom was a bit sheer with a slit that exposed more than i was comfortable with especially since i have spider veins and prefer to keep my legs covered i had no trouble taking it to my local seamstress and for just  she sealed up the slit for me which was an easy fixthe dress does come with a builtin slip but i added a shorter slip underneath to avoid a princess di moment—especially since it was an outdoor weddingjust in case overall this dress was the perfect choice for me i felt confident comfortable and most importantly pretty,1

I ordered the 'catch my drift' color way and the color is a grey washed denim, which look SO SICK! The sizing is spot on, just like most Levi's are. I wear a 36 inch waist, and I ordered the 36 inch. They fit so great! The denim is also somewhat flexible, and stretches plenty so you don't feel restricted while wearing them. I have been skateboarding in them multiple times, and the pants are so comfortable and durable to the rigors I've put them through. Overall, I'd definitely recommend trying these out! These jeans are absolutely one of my favorites! The price is worth every penny! 10/10 rating!",these levis  jeans are perfect i was wanting a new pair of baggy jeans but not too baggy or oversized too the shape of the levis  is an exquisite mix of baggyoversized i ordered the catch my drift color way and the color is a grey washed denim which look so sick the sizing is spot on just like most levis are i wear a  inch waist and i ordered the  inch they fit so great the denim is also somewhat flexible and stretches plenty so you dont feel restricted while wearing them i have been skateboarding in them multiple times and the pants are so comfortable and durable to the rigors ive put them through overall id definitely recommend trying these out these jeans are absolutely one of my favorites the price is worth every penny  rating,1
"**Review for PURE CHAMP Men's 3 Pack Fleece Active Athletic Workout Jogger Sweatpants**I recently purchased the PURE CHAMP Men's 3 Pack Fleece Active Athletic Workout Jogger Sweatpants, and I’m thoroughly impressed with my experience. Here are my thoughts:**Comfort and Fit:**These joggers are incredibly comfortable! The fleece material is soft against the skin, making them perfect for lounging or workouts. The fit is true to size, accommodating a range of body types. I appreciate the elastic waistband with a drawstring, allowing for a customizable fit that stays in place during physical activities.**Design and Functionality:**The joggers feature a sleek design that looks great whether I’m at the gym or running errands. The inclusion of zipper pockets is a fantastic touch—these pockets are deep enough to securely hold my phone and keys without the fear of losing them. This functionality makes them ideal for both workouts and casual outings.**Durability:**After several washes and workouts, the joggers have held up well. There’s no pilling or fading, which speaks to the quality of the fabric. They maintain their shape and softness, which is impressive for fleece material.**Versatility:**I love how versatile these joggers are. They can easily transition from workout wear to everyday casual attire. I’ve worn them for jogging, lounging at home, and even for a casual night out, paired with a nice hoodie.**Value for Money:**Getting three pairs in one pack is a great deal! Considering the quality and comfort, these joggers offer excellent value for the price.**Final Thoughts:**Overall, I highly recommend the PURE CHAMP Men's 3 Pack Fleece Active Athletic Workout Jogger Sweatpants.

"I have these shirts in at least one other color, so buying another pair at $13 below MSRP was a great deal. These shorts are too sheer for me to wear by themselves, but they work well when paired with some above the knee compression or running shorts that are also too sheer to be worn alone.The one thing that I wish more manufacturers did was to have the drawstring overlap in the front, but I understand that would mean additional costs. It makes the drawstring fit better and feels more secure. It only took me about 5 minutes using a single (smooth) chopstick to have the drawstring overlap, which I do with all my shorts.",i have these shirts in at least one other color so buying another pair at  below msrp was a great deal these shorts are too sheer for me to wear by themselves but they work well when paired with some above the knee compression or running shorts that are also too sheer to be worn alonethe one thing that i wish more manufacturers did was to have the drawstring overlap in the front but i understand that would mean additional costs it makes the drawstring fit better and feels more secure it only took me about  minutes using a single smooth chopstick to have the drawstring overlap which i do with all my shorts,1

"At a certain point in life, a man reaches a deeper understanding.  A viewpoint that permanently alters his worldview, and makes him question all that came before.  This can happen slowly, as experience and knowledge grows, and ultimately crystalizes around a kernel of this new perspective.  Or it can happen suddenly, in an epiphany of recognition that forces a foundational frame of reference adjustment.  Yesterday I experienced the latter, and I wanted to share it in case any of you have yet to reach a similar point.  As enter the fall of life, I feel compelled to offer this new personal world order in the hope that you may benefit longer than I will likely enjoy.While this change thunder-struck me suddenly yesterday, some background will help put the revelation in proper context.  It all started with the bankruptcy of Sears.  Sears engaged in a foolhardy acquisition strategy during the 1980's of retail and non-retail businesses that would be completely undercut by the digital revolution of the 1990's.  The debt accumulated from these various acquisitions would drag on company financial statements for decades as revenues slowly eroded to online shopping alternatives.  Finally, in the face of an unmanageable October 2018 debt payment of $134 million, Sears declared Chapter 11.  Eddie Lampert made several attempts to secure funding for a reorganization strategy, but they would all ultimately fail.  None of this impacted me until the end of 2019 when the last Sears in Jacksonville closed.At that point I had a shoe problem.  For decades I had purchased brown four-hole lace-up suede loafers from Sears.  They were a store brand that sold for $30 or $40.  I had probably purchased a dozen or more pair of these.  I would often buy two or three pair at a time so I wouldn't need to return to the store so often as they wore out.  But now Sears and my default shoe choice were gone!  Panic ensued.  I started searching the internet for the manufacturer of this shoe which I had enjoyed for so many years.  The hope was that another distribution channel would emerge, or that a transition to online sales could be found.  No luck.  So at the dawn of COVID-19, I was facing an existential shoe crisis.It was about March 2020 when my last trusty Sears loafers were at end-of-life.  Most real world retail was shuttered, and supply chain disruption was in full force.  There were no shoes to buy.  Finally, a local Rack Room reopened and I scoured the shelves for a suitable replacement.  I eventually settled for a deck style shoe that was only mildly stylistically objectionable, but seemed acceptably comfortable as one of the very few models offered in wide width.  For nearly two and a half years this daily worn (weekday) pair of shoes sustained me.  Last week I was forced back to the retail experience for a hopefully improved selection of casual shoe options.Did I find an improved post-COVID selection?  Hell no, I did not!  It was WAY worse.  There were no wide offerings at all!  Three shoe store visits left me cursing the pathetic state of IRL retail, and the stupid business people who were essentially forcing me to shop online.  So home to Amazon I went, with the name of an untried shoe brand and model seen in a store.  It was a pleasing looking set of footwear that I was going to gamble might be suitable.  And the size variety available on Amazon was breathtaking.  All the sizes I was familiar with, that were completely missing from any store, were available with a click.  I don't know when stores decided that they couldn't offer size selection.  They certainly did in the 1970's!  How did they lose that ability?  Anyway, shoes selected and ordered online with delivery anticipated in a couple days.  Fine.Ladies and gentleman, this is it.  These Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes are THE most comfortable shoes I have ever owned...bar none.  I am gobsmacked by how comfortable these shoes are.  Eureka is right!  I think back to pre-Rockport me and shake my head in sorrow.  Poor fella.  Stuck in a rut of frugally driven brick-and-mortar retail based consumption resulting in the bare minimum of utility.  Not even guessing about the possibility that such a paradigm shift could be out there.  Who knows what might have been if that version of me had found these shoes earlier?  Years of an improved outlook on life is the most obvious missed opportunity.  Perhaps he would have turned to philanthropy?  Trying to engineer life improvements for those around him in an effort to induce similar outlook-altering reactions in society's less fortunate?  I literally skipped around the house yesterday sharing the good news with my family.  I haven't skipped since a 1973 visit to Cedar Point with my Aunt Fran.  Eureka my friends.  Eureka indeed.  If you're in need, I beg you to give these shoes a try.  If I can convince just one of you, then this lunchtime prose will have been worth it.Edit: Two year update on durability - These spectacular shoes have been part of my workday fit for two years now.  No major durability issues to report.  The highest wear was on the insole.  The soles still have quite a bit of life, and are still well attached to the uppers.  One black pair I bought has fully thrown their insoles, and the brown pair have significantly worn insoles.  I still feel that this wear pattern is above average compared to my past shoe purchases.  So much so, I just ordered another pair of both black and brown Rockport Oxford Eureka Walking Shoes.

"These are excellent walking shoes. They are NOT leather, but some soft, leather-like, breathable synthetic material. In some ways better than leather because you can just wipe them clean with a moist cloth. Very comfortable. The memory foam insole is like nothing I've ever experienced.

I really like this coat for the price. Great style but it's cut a tad small. I'm 6' and weigh 260 with a stocky build. I typically wear a 2xl but glad I ordered a 3xl. The inside phone pocket is about 6' too low to reach easily but the outer phone pocket is at the proper height. This coat has some weight to it so it feels like quality . The inside sleeves are silky and the liner is really vozy fleece. I'm glad the hood is removable but I wish the zipper was concealed instead of exposed with the hood removed. The outer material feels ok with a slight texture but doesn't feel durable (maybe I'm wrong). I would have liked a heavier nylon sturdier material but this coat was so inexpensive if it only lasts a few years I would buy it again. This is really a good buy and I can't wait to wear it tomorrow! 5 stars,i really like this coat for the price great style but its cut a tad small im  and weigh  with a stocky build i typically wear a xl but glad i ordered a xl the inside phone pocket is about  too low to reach easily but the outer phone pocket is at the proper height this coat has some weight to it so it feels like quality  the inside sleeves are silky and the liner is really vozy fleece im glad the hood is removable but i wish the zipper was concealed instead of exposed with the hood removed the outer material feels ok with a slight texture but doesnt feel durable maybe im wrong i would have liked a heavier nylon sturdier material but this coat was so inexpensive if it only lasts a few years i would buy it again this is really a good buy and i cant wait to wear it tomorrow  stars,1

"These shirts are just what I was looking for.  Nice stretch, allowing for easy removal when at the gym after working out and sweating.  The sizing is a little bit off like they were made for a smaller Asian fit as the large is actually smaller than some of the DSG shirts that I own that are mediums.  And the collar are standard T-shirt type collars unlike the ones that are on under Armour or the DSG shirts that I have but for the price, you really can’t beat them.

These shirts are light weight polyester.  Take them out of the washer and just hang them up...no wrinkles!  My size depends on the actual item.  Large or XLarge is my situation.  My choice is to go bigger than something too tight.  Before I would buy these types of shirts at the mall.  Would be able to try on.....I got the XL...and it fits perfect.  I am very careful about using the dryer on my clothes.....do not want any shrinkage.....so I dry for a 5-10 minutes...especially for jeans.....few minutes for shirts...and hang them up to dry.  These shirts I washed like anything brand new.  Even right out of the washer no wrinkles....and hung them up on hangers to dry.  Perfect!  The colors are nice...and the shirts are comfortable.  I will only buy polyester...not a mix with cotton....the material mixed with cotton does not come out wrinkle free and does not feel as good ....just my personal taste.  My suggestions is to buy a size larger...out of the washer on to hangers...and let the sun or warm house do the drying...and do not bake them in a dryer....not just these shirts but any synthetic fabrics....,these shirts are light weight polyester  take them out of the washer and just hang them upno wrinkles  my size depends on the actual item  large or xlarge is my situation  my choice is to go bigger than something too tight  before i would buy these types of shirts at the mall  would be able to try oni got the xland it fits perfect  i am very careful about using the dryer on my clothesdo not want any shrinkageso i dry for a  minutesespecially for jeansfew minutes for shirtsand hang them up to dry  these shirts i washed like anything brand new  even right out of the washer no wrinklesand hung them up on hangers to dry  perfect  the colors are niceand the shirts are comfortable  i will only buy polyesternot a mix with cottonthe material mixed with cotton does not come out wrinkle free and does not feel as good just my personal taste  my suggestions is to buy a size largerout of the washer on to hangersand let the sun or warm house do the dryingand do not bake them in a dryernot just these shirts but any synthetic fabrics,1

"This review will be similar to another review I read here, because it was completely on point.Pros:  I was pleasantly surprised how well this fit and how cute it was.  I attended a wedding and received many compliments on the dress. I like how the sleeves cover my arms, but are sheer, so it's cool enough for spring/ fall.  The cut was perfect to cover my chubby mom tummy, but still very classy and flattering. Material is very light and flowy.  I feel very comfortable in this.Cons: The dress is pretty short. I'm only 5'4 (170lb). I got the size Large, and you can see it's still pretty short on me.  Wearing this outside, the wind caught the fabric a few times and I def had several Marilyn Monroe moments... I'm sure I revealed more than anyone wanted to see that night.  The snap on the cleavage area worked for me (I'm a 38C), but it was pretty cheap... felt if I moved the wrong way that it could bust open at any moment and also reveal more than I'd like.  So maybe a safety pin would be more secure.Overall, I tried on like 30 dresses from Amazon... this was the clear winner, and I'd definitely wear this again! (Maybe on a non- windy day to an indoor event lol)Ps... don't mind the dusty mirror, but wanted to show how this dress looked.",this review will be similar to another review i read here because it was completely on pointpros  i was pleasantly surprised how well this fit and how cute it was  i attended a wedding and received many compliments on the dress i like how the sleeves cover my arms but are sheer so its cool enough for spring fall  the cut was perfect to cover my chubby mom tummy but still very classy and flattering material is very light and flowy  i feel very comfortable in thiscons the dress is pretty short im only  lb i got the size large and you can see its still pretty short on me  wearing this outside the wind caught the fabric a few times and i def had several marilyn monroe moments im sure i revealed more than anyone wanted to see that night  the snap on the cleavage area worked for me im a c but it was pretty cheap felt if i moved the wrong way that it could bust open at any moment and also reveal more than id like  so maybe a safety pin would be more secureoverall i tried on like  dresses from amazon this was the clear winner and id definitely wear this again maybe on a non windy day to an indoor event lolps dont mind the dusty mirror but wanted to show how this dress looked,1

I am more athletic\\thicker built and have a hard time finding skinny/slim/tapered jeans that fit well. I ordered a size up and I would recommend that for anyone that doesn’t have a butt or skinny legs. If you’re more skinny-built then you might be fine true to size. They are very stretchy (but still slightly tight in the seat). I haven’t washed them yet so can’t say regarding how they hold up.

"Perfect. The material is solid and price is extremely fair for the type of fabric. These pants will absolutely last me a long time with weight gain and loss but currently with weight loss. I’m considering buy a pair as back up and at size 34 when I’m at the weight I need to be at. I’m a big believer in supporting a product by buying multiples of that item and I think this is one of those. I bought these pants in black, grey and Indian khaki and they go great with the dress shirts I wear for work, which are business casual.Alternatively, as far as fit is concerned, the inside tag below the washer label states a Levi Strauss company so LEVI’s? I love these and I’ve never owned Levi’s but I might dip my toes in that pool. Please keep in mind that I own some off brand dress pants in black, khaki and grey and they’re in my closest but will be discarded because of the quality of material, loose like fit and the material tends to attract a ton of lint.If you are scared by the price, pull the trigger as they are worth it and I see these as lasting for a long time and I personally intend on buying multiples before they change the fit or material.

"So, since childhood, it's been the classic tighty whities, rocking the Walter White style, but I've long heard the rumors of boxer bliss.  Tried full on boxers, and couldn't stand them, it felt like wearing shorts under my pants, too much bulk and bunching up and just not pleasant.  But, the boxer brief is said to be the best of all worlds, more freedom than briefs, but not as much chaos as boxers.  Well into my adult life, I figured it's still good to try new things, and didn't want to miss out on a chance at more comfy under gear.I opted for this brand because I like Gildan t-shirts.  I came across the brand originally, noting that, at race and car events I attend, t-shirts being sold by vendors are often the Gildan brand, and they fit and wear well.  I've since bought just plain Gildan t-shirts that I've found here, and been very happy.  So, it seemed a trusted brand, and the price is certainly right, so, if I hated this new under the pants idea, I wouldn't have lost much, was my logic.Ordered up my first set of 5, and, whaddya know, I LOVE boxer briefs!  These are a soft knit, like a t-shirt but heavier weight, so, super comfortable, keeps everything where it should be, and doesn't ride up on the legs -- fits at the thighs perfectly, not too tight, but not too loose.As a bonus, as the weather has turned cold, they are pleasantly warm to wear, but not hot or bothersome, so I'm feeling they will work in summer as well.  I promptly ordered another 5 pair set, and likely will order a third set soon, for those times when laundry is piling up and the underwear drawer reserves are running low.Love the waistband on these, fully covered elastic and, again, perfect balance of being snug, so not moving around, but not at all uncomfortable in terms of tightness.  Works great with tucked in dress shirts and slacks, works with jeans, shorts, anything and everything.All of the ones I received were very well made, no quality control issues, have held up well in the wash, colors didn't bleed on anything, and I have a feeling they may even last longer than the briefs of old, which, no matter what brand I've tried in the past years, have seemed to decline in quality in terms of holding up through wash cycles (elastic at the waist frequently starts to ripple and become a bit useless).So, look at me go!  Never too late to try something new and my underwear wearing has become quite a joy.  They seem far more stylish than plain old briefs, and are much more comfortable, so I'm now a boxer brief convert, and will retire the old briefs habit, in favor of my new cool undergarments.Definitely recommend these.  I see other brands are far pricier, so it seems this is one of the best buys.Hope this helps your shopping.

That is not the case with these shirts.  They fit well and are comfortable in motion.  The design is minimalist, in a good way.  I love the tagless tags that are printed into the fabric so they don't chafe the back of my neck although the white printing on the heather gray shirt is difficult to see so it takes a few seconds to ensure I don't put the shirt on backwards.  These shirts breathe well and have a quality silky feel because of the tightly woven synthetic material, but are durable even though they're fairly thin.  These are great sunscreen without any greasy smelly mess.  I bought a similar name brand long polyester sleeve shirt in the mid 1980's for sunscreen when rock climbing, and paid almost as much (much more after accounting for inflation) as I paid for these six shirts, and honestly, I like these shirts better.Note that the black shirts are a dark navy blue.",cheap in price but not in quality  ive purchased inexpensive shirts and pull over sweaters on amazon and the fit has been poor usually weird in the shoulders and binding in odd places when i move as if someone cut out two dimensional paper doll clothes and stitched them together  that is not the case with these shirts  they fit well and are comfortable in motion  the design is minimalist in a good way  i love the tagless tags that are printed into the fabric so they dont chafe the back of my neck although the white printing on the heather gray shirt is difficult to see so it takes a few seconds to ensure i dont put the shirt on backwards  these shirts breathe well and have a quality silky feel because of the tightly woven synthetic material but are durable even though theyre fairly thin  these are great sunscreen without any greasy smelly mess  i bought a similar name brand long polyester sleeve shirt in the mid s for sunscreen when rock climbing and paid almost as much much more after accounting for inflation as i paid for these six shirts and honestly i like these shirts betternote that the black shirts are a dark navy blue,1
"My teenage son is an athlete and wears these pants constantly to work out in & for daily wear. I've bought multiple 3 packs of these pants in different colors & in both the small and medium sizes. They are very comfortable for everyday wear and also for the most part decent quality. We've only encountered a couple pair that have loose threads (out of about 15 pair 2 or 3 of them have had small holes or gaps in between the legs that of course turned into larger holes fairly quickly). The camo colored ones have discolored areas that wear thin in the leg/knee and thigh area and look like they don't hold up after a couple of washes.Overall, these pants are a good buy. I'd recommend the striped dark colored ones the most.

"As a taller guy (6’4”, 215lbs), finding workout shorts that fit well can be a challenge, but these actually worked out great for me. I went with a large based on the size chart, and they fit just right—not too tight, not too loose. The length is spot on, hitting just above the knee, and the relaxed fit gives me plenty of room to move during squats, lunges, and runs. The fabric is super lightweight and breathable, which is a lifesaver during intense workouts, and the quick-dry feature really does help keep things comfortable even when I’m sweating a lot. The waistband is snug but not restrictive, and the drawcord is a nice touch for keeping everything in place. I also appreciate the zippered pockets—they’re deep enough to hold my phone and keys without them bouncing around. That said, the mesh panels are great for airflow but I’d recommend wearing them with compression shorts if that bothers you. After a few washes, I did not notice a fade and the stitching and fabric still feel durable. Overall, these are a solid choice for taller guys like me who need reliable workout shorts. I’d definitely recommend them if you’re in a similar size range.",as a taller guy ’” lbs finding workout shorts that fit well can be a challenge but these actually worked out great for me i went with a large based on the size chart and they fit just right—not too tight not too loose the length is spot on hitting just above the knee and the relaxed fit gives me plenty of room to move during squats lunges and runs the fabric is super lightweight and breathable which is a lifesaver during intense workouts and the quickdry feature really does help keep things comfortable even when i’m sweating a lot the waistband is snug but not restrictive and the drawcord is a nice touch for keeping everything in place i also appreciate the zippered pockets—they’re deep enough to hold my phone and keys without them bouncing around that said the mesh panels are great for airflow but i’d recommend wearing them with compression shorts if that bothers you after a few washes i did not notice a fade and the stitching and fabric still feel durable overall these are a solid choice for taller guys like me who need reliable workout shorts i’d definitely recommend them if you’re in a similar size range,1
"The men’s casual Henley shirt is a fantastic addition to any wardrobe. The fabric is soft and breathable, making it comfortable to wear throughout the day. The fit is true to size and provides a relaxed, yet flattering silhouette. The three-button placket adds a touch of classic style, and the shirt can be dressed up or down depending on the occasion.The quality of the material is impressive—it's durable and maintains its shape and color even after multiple washes. The shirt also has a nice drape that doesn’t feel too heavy or too light. The variety of colors available makes it easy to find one that suits your personal style.One small consideration is that the shirt might require a bit of ironing to maintain a crisp appearance, but this is a minor issue compared to its overall comfort and style.Overall, this Henley shirt is a versatile, stylish, and comfortable choice for casual wear.

"I picked these up for my travels. They’re super lightweight, which really helps reduce the weight of my luggage.

I wore them dry during long day trips and wet when swimming, and they held up perfectly.Made from 100% cotton, they’re breathable, and since they’re disposable, it’s great that cotton is biodegradable, so they won’t harm the environment.

"I was surprised how well these shirts fit me. Very comfortable but not overly loose or baggy. The material is higher quality than I expected, and the biggest positive for me is that they require no ironing at all, which is the main reason I purchased them. A nice variety of colors, and although it’s only been one wash they seem to hold up well. As a discount store shopper I would say these are easily better quality and value. My only nitpick is the large logo (star patch) on the arm of the shirts. I am not one to care about name brands but if you buy a 5 pack like I did it’s hard not to feel a little self conscious about how obvious the logo gives away the fact that you buy your clothes in bulk.

These shoes go with just about every outfit and are so comfortable. They are not a pure white but an off white so they look a bit lived in already which I like. They run slightly small so I would definitely suggest going up a 1/2 size from your normal size. I ordered my normal size (8) but they were too tight so I sized up to an 8.5 and they fit perfectly. I think they are a great alternative to an AF1 by giving the same vibe but slightly less bulky in my opinion.

It's something that's hard to ignore while I'm wearing them, which is preventing these a bit from being my go-to pants.  So while I'd say they run true to size, and look good, the feeling during movement is where I am having the most issues.  I will keep these pants but probably would not repurchase another pair if I had the chance.",overall im pretty happy with my purchase  id say these definitely have the look i was going for  my main gripe is that i wish there was more flexstretch in the knees  when i move bend or sit the stretch sensation feels like the pants are tighter than they really are  its something thats hard to ignore while im wearing them which is preventing these a bit from being my goto pants  so while id say they run true to size and look good the feeling during movement is where i am having the most issues  i will keep these pants but probably would not repurchase another pair if i had the chance,1

"I bought this jacket first five years ago and ordered a large, which was my standard size at the time. What I got back then was a quality jacket but one that could be a bit uncomfortable to wear given that the arms were insulated with a weird material and it also ran quite small. Still, I rather liked it and thought it looked really nice, so I wore it until I put on some weight and outgrew it.Eventually ordered a new one in XXL, which is what I order in jackets now because I like them to be a little loose and baggy when I'm at work, my t-shirt size is XL. New version of the jacket is of even higher quality. The material it's made of still feels strong but is very very smooth almost like suede, and the arm insultation is vastly better. The XXL feels like it ran a little big this time, as it's quite loose on me now, moreso than other jackets I order in that size, but for me this is fine. I could easily wear a big sweater or hoodie with it in cold weather and still fit comfortably. If you're unsure, I would say you would likely be safe ordering this in your usual size even if you like things to hang a little looser. I bought the brown/'tobacco' color and it is an extremely attractive jacket I feel like I could wear a lot of places from my messy custodial job to mountain hiking to dinner at like a sit down sushi place. It's of a quality and appearance that I feel you could wear this on a date or a night out and you would look quite nice. The buttons look quite nice and are kind of a weathered brass look. Previous jacket had a problem with the wrist buttons coming undone constantly, seems to be fixed in this one. The flannel insulation is not thick and I would consider this more of a spring/fall jacket, but I could easily layer it if the temperatures dropped.",i bought this jacket first five years ago and ordered a large which was my standard size at the time what i got back then was a quality jacket but one that could be a bit uncomfortable to wear given that the arms were insulated with a weird material and it also ran quite small still i rather liked it and thought it looked really nice so i wore it until i put on some weight and outgrew iteventually ordered a new one in xxl which is what i order in jackets now because i like them to be a little loose and baggy when im at work my tshirt size is xl new version of the jacket is of even higher quality the material its made of still feels strong but is very very smooth almost like suede and the arm insultation is vastly better the xxl feels like it ran a little big this time as its quite loose on me now moreso than other jackets i order in that size but for me this is fine i could easily wear a big sweater or hoodie with it in cold weather and still fit comfortably if youre unsure i would say you would likely be safe ordering this in your usual size even if you like things to hang a little looser i bought the browntobacco color and it is an extremely attractive jacket i feel like i could wear a lot of places from my messy custodial job to mountain hiking to dinner at like a sit down sushi place its of a quality and appearance that i feel you could wear this on a date or a night out and you would look quite nice the buttons look quite nice and are kind of a weathered brass look previous jacket had a problem with the wrist buttons coming undone constantly seems to be fixed in this one the flannel insulation is not thick and i would consider this more of a springfall jacket but i could easily layer it if the temperatures dropped,1

"I seldom purchase clothes online due to numerous past disappointments. However, I decided to give this shirt a try, and to my surprise, it's a great fit, comfortable, and I believe it looks good on me. Encouraged by this, I ordered three more in different colors. I chose size XX Large, and they fit perfectly. As someone who usually wears t-shirts and jeans, I appreciate the shirt's simple design and solid color. The fabric is lightweight, which is ideal for Florida's summer heat. After about eight washes, I'm writing this review, and I'm pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads, which speaks well for their quality and consistency, especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems.",i seldom purchase clothes online due to numerous past disappointments however i decided to give this shirt a try and to my surprise its a great fit comfortable and i believe it looks good on me encouraged by this i ordered three more in different colors i chose size xx large and they fit perfectly as someone who usually wears tshirts and jeans i appreciate the shirts simple design and solid color the fabric is lightweight which is ideal for floridas summer heat after about eight washes im writing this review and im pleased to report that the shirts have neither lost any buttons nor have any loose threads which speaks well for their quality and consistency especially since all four shirts have held up well in the wash and dryer without any problems,1

"I lost weight, so ordered these, a size (2 inches) smaller than my last pair. Now I will say that Dickies pants run small. My waist was about 42 when I ordered the 44's. Now my waist is about 39 or 40, and these 42's fit fine. The only reason I'm not giving these pants five stars is that one of my last pair, having only been worn a few times, lost the zipper pull when unzipping them. I mean it came right off in my hand and now I can't find it of course and don't know how to fix it, or if it can even be fixed, or if it's worth what it would cost to have someone fix it. It's the first time this has happened. It did NOT happen with this particular blue pair, yet. Hopefully it will not. I love these pants in general for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that they are kind of stain proof and even slightly water resistant. I did notice that these seemed too short, however, while the 44/32's I ordered in the past were too long. There is no option in between so next time I will order the 32 length as I can cuff them up, that is fine with me. UPDATE: I lost a lot more weight, and ordered a pair of 34/32's recently, which were called ""khaki"" as pictured above, and on some seller's sites that same color pictured was called ""desert sand"". The pair I received was not the light color pictured, it was a greenish tinged tan color, almost grey looking ""tan"" color. On some seller's sites they picture the color I received, calling it ""maple"" or ""washed maple"". In other photos ""maple"" is a more yellowish warm light brown. My point is, do NOT trust the photos on ANY of the sellers pages selling Dickie's work pants, at least when it comes to the tan/khaki colors. Black is black..(or is it?? haha). I kept them anyway, they are for work and it didn't matter but if you want a particular color of khaki, you better go buy it at an actual store.",i lost weight so ordered these a size  inches smaller than my last pair now i will say that dickies pants run small my waist was about  when i ordered the s now my waist is about  or  and these s fit fine the only reason im not giving these pants five stars is that one of my last pair having only been worn a few times lost the zipper pull when unzipping them i mean it came right off in my hand and now i cant find it of course and dont know how to fix it or if it can even be fixed or if its worth what it would cost to have someone fix it its the first time this has happened it did not happen with this particular blue pair yet hopefully it will not i love these pants in general for many reasons not the least of which is the fact that they are kind of stain proof and even slightly water resistant i did notice that these seemed too short however while the s i ordered in the past were too long there is no option in between so next time i will order the  length as i can cuff them up that is fine with me update i lost a lot more weight and ordered a pair of s recently which were called khaki as pictured above and on some sellers sites that same color pictured was called desert sand the pair i received was not the light color pictured it was a greenish tinged tan color almost grey looking tan color on some sellers sites they picture the color i received calling it maple or washed maple in other photos maple is a more yellowish warm light brown my point is do not trust the photos on any of the sellers pages selling dickies work pants at least when it comes to the tankhaki colors black is blackor is it haha i kept them anyway they are for work and it didnt matter but if you want a particular color of khaki you better go buy it at an actual store,1

"I got the Ultra Performance Fleece Active Tech Joggers for my boyfriend, and he absolutely loves them! He’s always raving about how soft and warm the fleece lining is, especially on colder days.

The adjustable waistband gives him a perfect fit, and he finds them super comfortable to wear for long periods.He’s particularly impressed with the zippered pockets—finally, joggers that securely hold his phone and wallet without worrying about them falling out! After several washes, they’ve held up incredibly well with no fading or pilling, which speaks to their great durability.The sleek, modern design makes them versatile enough for casual outings, and he says they’re perfect for pairing with his favorite hoodies or tees.

"The quality is solid. It has Sturdy fabric, good stitching, and they feel like they’ll hold up well over time. That said, the sizing can be a little tricky. I’d recommend sizing up on the waist since they run a bit small there, especially if you prefer a comfortable fit. On the flip side, the length tends to be generous, so sizing down in that department might save you from extra hemming or awkward bunching. Overall, great jeans for the price, just tweak the sizes to get them spot-on.",the quality is solid it has sturdy fabric good stitching and they feel like they’ll hold up well over time that said the sizing can be a little tricky i’d recommend sizing up on the waist since they run a bit small there especially if you prefer a comfortable fit on the flip side the length tends to be generous so sizing down in that department might save you from extra hemming or awkward bunching overall great jeans for the price just tweak the sizes to get them spoton,1

"I've been weeding out old clothes and replacing them with new stuff. I had three old pairs of cargo style shorts that had seen better days. I wanted a pair with zipper pockets and that were a bit more modern; not so big and baggy. This fit the bill pretty well. The material is super comfortable and stretchy. The zipper pockets work great and they fit nicely. I love that these come in size 33! So many things don't these days. I initially tried the 34 and they were too big so I swapped for the 33 and they are perfect. The sit just above the knee which is pretty good.

"Exactly what I wanted.  Been wearing these pants in one form or another for over 20 years.  They’re very comfortable.  These ones I got, are the softer material.  It’s not the plasticy nylon type material that wooshes between your thighs when you walk.  It’s the nice and soft variety.  I have had two thicknesses of these pants, these are the thinner material.  If you daily these like I do, then you will probably appreciate this review clearing up exactly what you can expect.On this occasion I got the XL Tall size.  The price was right, so I ordered several pairs in differing colors.  I’ve never tried the tall size.  As far as I can tell they’re roughly the same as standard XL, maybe a little tighter around the thighs.  The pairs I own I’ve had for awhile and maybe they’re stretched out, so maybe it’s the same, but these are definitely tighter around the thigh than the pairs I’ve had for years.  I have large thighs, if you don’t have large thighs, it won’t bother you.  It doesn’t bother me actually, but I can tell they’re a little tighter than normal.  Which is fine, it’s good to have a bit of variety and they’ll probably stretch the older they get.  I just hope they don’t shrink in the wash.  One thing unique about these pants is they typically do not shrink in the dryer.  So the tall aspect of the size, yes they are 2 inches, I believe, longer than your standard XL.  I already dragged the pant cuffs around on the carpet, it’s just a little more noticeable.I think you should be able to see in the pic I attached to my review the fabric of these pants to help aid you in determining what it is you’ll get.I hope that helped out one of my fellow ADIDAS track pants lovers out there.",exactly what i wanted  been wearing these pants in one form or another for over  years  they’re very comfortable  these ones i got are the softer material  it’s not the plasticy nylon type material that wooshes between your thighs when you walk  it’s the nice and soft variety  i have had two thicknesses of these pants these are the thinner material  if you daily these like i do then you will probably appreciate this review clearing up exactly what you can expecton this occasion i got the xl tall size  the price was right so i ordered several pairs in differing colors  i’ve never tried the tall size  as far as i can tell they’re roughly the same as standard xl maybe a little tighter around the thighs  the pairs i own i’ve had for awhile and maybe they’re stretched out so maybe it’s the same but these are definitely tighter around the thigh than the pairs i’ve had for years  i have large thighs if you don’t have large thighs it won’t bother you  it doesn’t bother me actually but i can tell they’re a little tighter than normal  which is fine it’s good to have a bit of variety and they’ll probably stretch the older they get  i just hope they don’t shrink in the wash  one thing unique about these pants is they typically do not shrink in the dryer  so the tall aspect of the size yes they are  inches i believe longer than your standard xl  i already dragged the pant cuffs around on the carpet it’s just a little more noticeablei think you should be able to see in the pic i attached to my review the fabric of these pants to help aid you in determining what it is you’ll geti hope that helped out one of my fellow adidas track pants lovers out there,1

"I read the critical reviews, and still ordered it.  Amazon even warns that this particular item has a more-than-usual return rate.  I am keeping mine.  First is the material.  Polyester/Spandex could mean almost any thing; it is not Italian wool and I did not expect it to look like it was.  I have no idea how the material will hold up.  The size and styling is called slim fit which means it is not made for most American men.  I take a size 2 -- I am too short, too fat, too old.  Nothing off the rack is gonna fit me.  For pants I need a 40 inch waist and a 24 inch inseam.  I have a small chest with a big pot belly. I buy dress shirts at Macy's and expect to double the price when I add in the tailoring needed. This jacket was priced at about the same as a good weight pair of 501 jeans.  I was not expecting bespoke fit or construction.  The next up is the design.  It is called 'a blazer' .  For me that means patch pockets and contrasting metal buttons.  This jacket has neither.  The three sleeve buttons had sparse button hole stitching.  It was so fake that when I had the sleeves shortened, I had similar decorative stitching added to continue the joke.  It does not have the typical fake stitched button hole on the lapel that is convenient for wearing decorative or identifying pins. The pockets are slit with flaps.  It may not be clear from the pictures, but there are two inner pockets and the jacket is fully lined.  Yes it is very light weight.  But now, even in the heart of winter, I rarely will be wanting to wear my real bespoke Shetland Wool tweed sport coat.  Everywhere is heated much warmer now.  Also, it has center vent, not mentioned.  That is important for me because the usual side vents show off my big butt.I wanted a light weight jacket that looked better than a zippered hoody, for casual wear -- unbuttoned -- year round.

"I think Amazon recommended size XL, perhaps not. I normally wear a size XL or L. However, I don't think this shirt fits as intended in this size XL on me. I looked at the measurements on the size chart, and I should have sized down at least one size. The shoulder seams were way past the edge of my shoulders, and it was large and loose overall. The neck opening was especially large, and the sleeves were almost all the way down to my wrists.This shirt may not be long enough for some longer torso ladies, depending on preferences. It is not tunic length, I am 5'2 with a short torso and it hit me a little past mid hip. This shirt looks like it is pricier than it was. The material is very soft, and a good light to medium weight, without being see through, at least in the black color. It is a very fine and stretchy t-shirt material, almost like a spring sweater.Unfortunately, due to sizing, I have to return. It is a very nice shirt, though.

"The short answer to if you should go down from your typical size or not: yes, you probably should; that is, if you only plan on wearing this shirt jacket without layering.  However, if you plan on wearing this with a bulker hoodie or something similar underneath OR you have a larger stomach, then probably not.  If you are interested in more specifics, please continue reading. . .I wanted a heavier shirt jacket that I could wear over a light to medium-weight hoodie for the upcoming colder months.  I normally take an XL or a L depending on the brand, and if I plan on layering or not.  I have an athletic build (larger shoulders and chest and smaller waist), and, usually, when I plan on layering with a hoodie, I need an XL; but being that many said this runs large, I opted for a L.  Glad I did. . .The large fits well over my medium-weight hoodie, had just enough room for movement where I didn't feel like it was too tight and restricting.  It also fit well enough without the hoodie, not too loose and baggy.  If I would have gotten an XL as I normally would, then the fit would have been a little too loose for my liking, especially while wearing the jacket without layering.  Personally, I prefer a little a snugger fit since it holds in body heat better when working in below freezing temps; but my preference for a slightly snugger fit may not be pleasurable for you.  For reference, I am between 5'11 and 6 feet tall, weigh 200 lbs., have 53.5 inch shoulders, 47 inch chest and 33 inch waist (shoulders, chest and waist measured in circumference).If you are someone who likes a much looser fit and/or has a larger midsection, I would recommend getting your usual size -- at least.  This shirt jacket is more streamlined in the body than what many other shirt jackets are, so if you have a larger belly and went a size down, this shirt jacket will most likely be a bit too tight for you.  This I know:After I purchasing mine and wearing it a bit, I bought another one for my stepfather.  Unlike me, he has smaller shoulders. . .and a fairly large midsection.  He normally takes a L for his jackets, but since this shirt jacket runs a little large, I opted for a M.  It didn't fit.  It was OK for him in the shoulders, but the jacket wouldn't button over his larger belly.  I returned it and got a large for him, which then did fit over his larger midsection, but barely.This shirt jacket does have side pockets and one pocket inside up by the chest area for a smart phone, wallet or whatever.  One thing I should say about the side pockets is that they are awkwardly placed.  The manufacturer put the side pockets right on the seams where the front and back parts of the shirt jacket are sewn together, and so the pockets are a bit farther back from where typical side pockets would be -- from my experience anyway.  If you want to use them to warm your hands, you better have flexible shoulders.Also about the pockets. . .not the side ones, but the inside pocket up by the chest: Some people have commented that the Velcro is overly strong and thus there are some concerns of tearing the inner liner when pulling open the pocket.  Yes, it is strong, like most new Velcro is, but. . .if you grab each part of the Velcro with your hands and close and open it a couple of hundred times (this may sound like a lot work, but I did so in only a couple of minutes), the Velcro will loosen up. . .and considerably.The thing that I am the most disappointed with is the snap buttons: They are very weak.  The snap buttons are metal and look nice and sturdy, but several of them would not stay snapped together very well.  They would pop open with minimal effort, like bending over, for example. Thankfully, though, not all of them are so exceptionally wimpy -- just a few of them.  So for most part, the shirt jacket stayed partially buttoned.In all, this is a very nice looking, feeling and sturdy shirt jacket which is quite warm when worn with a hoodie.  It does a good job keeping out the wind and it appears to shed some water as well.  It also goes on and off very easily because of the inner nylon-lined sleeves. But because of the weakness of some of the snap buttons and the extreme side placement of the side pockets, I cannot give this more than four stars.*Update*I've been wearing this shirt jacket for approximately 18 months now, during Fall and Winter mostly, and it has held up well.  It has endured a lot of abuse during that time, and it still looks good -- no tears, no scratches and no coming undone at the seams.  But. . .as I stated before, those darn snap buttons sure could be a lot stronger.  Many times while I was out doing something strenuous, like cutting brush or shoveling a lot of snow, I looked down and saw the bottom half of the jacket unbuttoned.  I don't know if I got a bad batch of buttons, or if the rest of these shirt jackets are this way.  It is a minor complaint, but it does get a little annoying when working hard and then constantly having to rebutton the jacket.And as for how warm it is during winter. . .I'm impressed.  With the configuration of clothing I have shown in my photos (tee-shirt, long sleeve denim shirt, medium weight hoodie and this jacket) , I've been good in -25 to -30 temperatures (and that is not including the wind chill), that is, as long as I stay active.  My face and hands were another matter, though. . .I would like to be able upgrade my rating for this jacket, for the overall quality of this shirt jacket is high and it is also very warm.  But the weakness of the snap buttons prevents me from rating it better than what I originally did.**Second update**Been two and a half years of wearing this jacket. . .and it is still in excellent shape.  Even though I've put this shirt jacket though a lot of abuse (cutting, hauling and piling firewood, cutting multitudes of brush and many other outside jobs where I was crawling around in the dirt), the shell is still intact -- no tears or rips or seams coming undone.  The inside is fully intact as well.  Unfortunately, the metal snap buttons have weakened a bit more.  I recently took a photo of myself after I was done cutting down some balsam trees on my property.  You can get a better look at how the jacket looks in an outside environment.  And as testament to what I have been saying about the snap buttons, you can see that the lower half of the jacket is unbuttoned.  It is such a shame that these buttons are so weak, for it degrades the overall quality and appeal of this otherwise outstanding jacket.",the short answer to if you should go down from your typical

"Newborn onesies aren't cheap.  Well most aren't, but these aren't too bad.  I purchased these strictly for the price when compared to other sets.  I'm not too picky on what my daughter wears, but I prefer simply patterns and colors, not flashy patterns and definitely no characters or words.  These were actually cuter than I expected them to be.  The material is soft, the patterns and colors are cute, and the cut fits my daughter just right.IMPORTANT FITTING DETAILS:These run small, meaning that these were the FIRST newborn items that my daughter outgrew.  I liked this, because I had a small daughter at birth (7lb4oz) and I liked having clothes that almost fit her during those first few weeks (these were a tad big, but much less big than most of the newborn stuff I purchased).  However, they received the least amount of use.The buttons that snap at the bottom are higher up than most other onesies.  Looking at the stock picture, you can see that they are more on the front of the onesie than directly in the middle as most onesies are.  This isn't a problem by any means.  It just means that once your child starts outgrowing them and there is stretching at the buttons, it will be more noticable if your child is only wearing the onesie (no pants).  I prefer the look of buttons that are a bit lower, but I prefer this functionally during diaper changes.Bottom line:Cheap, cute onesies that fit a bit smaller and a bit differently than most other competitors.",newborn onesies arent cheap  well most arent but these arent too bad  i purchased these strictly for the price when compared to other sets  im not too picky on what my daughter wears but i prefer simply patterns and colors not flashy patterns and definitely no characters or words  these were actually cuter than i expected them to be  the material is soft the patterns and colors are cute and the cut fits my daughter just rightimportant fitting detailsthese run small meaning that these were the first newborn items that my daughter outgrew  i liked this because i had a small daughter at birth lboz and i liked having clothes that almost fit her during those first few weeks these were a tad big but much less big than most of the newborn stuff i purchased  however they received the least amount of usethe buttons that snap at the bottom are higher up than most other onesies  looking at the stock picture you can see that they are more on the front of the onesie than directly in the middle as most onesies are  this isnt a problem by any means  it just means that once your child starts outgrowing them and there is stretching at the buttons it will be more noticable if your child is only wearing the onesie no pants  i prefer the look of buttons that are a bit lower but i prefer this functionally during diaper changesbottom linecheap cute onesies that fit a bit smaller and a bit differently than most other competitors,1

"Wrangler Cowboy Cut Slim Fit 936. 32 x 36I normally wear a 32x32 in most of my jeans. And that length is great when wearing loafers or other types of low cut shoes.  I wanted something that would look better with my western boots, and that wouldn't become high waters when I sat down. I had purchased the same jeans in a 32 x 34 a few weeks ago. Those fit well. However,  I wasn't sure about if the length would shrink after washing. I do not plan to wash these often, of course when I get them dirty, these are more for use when I go out with my boots on.The 34 inch length just gave a slight stacking look, which will be nice. I have ironed a center crease in the 34's and they look sharp with a sport coat on. Not too much stacking.The 36's have a little more stack to them of course, but they sit right on the top of my heels of my boots. It's a great fit. The extra length assures me that I would have some decent amount of stacking after a wash.I gave them 4 stars, mainly because the front pockets are not very deep. I get how and why the back pockets are made that way, but another inch or so in the fronts would be mighty nice. This will not stop me from buying more, as I really do like the fit, and I get that they are patterned after the originals, and that's how they are made.The Amazon posting shows  stretch, but both pairs of mine are not stretchy at all, so i,m not sure about that feature.The waist size is spot on for me. They are snug, just like my other 32 waist jeans, just not restricting.Overall, great fit with my boots, and I do like them.

"I've worn a variety of button-up shirts over the years, from Prada to Carhartt, for different occasions – from operas to blue-collar work. Let me tell you this right now: this shirt can work for just about any occasion.What I love about it: the fit, feel, and durability. I lost a good amount of weight and needed to size down, I tried a few Amazon brands, and one black shirt really stood out. It's this model. I've had it for about a year, machine-washed and dried it regularly, and it still looks as good as new. I bought another one a couple months later.  It's 100% cotton, which I love for its breathability, but it does wrinkle a bit. Usually it's a trade off in shirts, but again; AMAZING FEEL. It's fairly light so definitely layer up if it's cold; I wore a merino wool base layer underneath and holy guacamole was I comfortable! Although it is long sleeve, it might not keep you the warmest alone, but if you use it in the spring/summer, you're going to love it. When I used it for working on my dad's farm, I honestly didn't care about the wrinkles, but it was never terrible wrinkling. In fact, I got the sleeves hemmed and noticed the wringling on the sleeves is minimal compared to how it was prior, so be prepared to stop by the tailor if you're on the shorter side for that perfect fit (def worth it though). If you ever want to use it for an interview or something, this might not be ideal, but definitely can pass if you hang it in the shower to steam and can impress if you take the time to iron and starche it. I'm on the shorter side, so I usually rolled up the sleeves to avoid wrinkling prior to getting them altered.I'm 5'6, and am just got the sleeves hemmed. I love this shirt so much I bought multiple. So it'll be nice having more colors in my wardrobe that are good quality and fit well. I'm a fan of the pocket too, even though I don't use it much.Now, here's the thing I don't like, and it's not what you'd expect. Have you ever heard of an expression, something along the lines of if you're not paying for it, someone else is in regards to fast fashion like Shein and such...It's the ethical aspect – I don't know who made this shirt or the conditions they worked in. I'm hoping the quality speaks for itself as this is far from the fast fashion quality you see in modern clothes nowadays. The price isn't terribly cheap...but still, it could be made by kids in the same environment as those old Nike documentaries. I've shifted to buying from countries where I know workers aren't exploited (such as in the USA or Japan). As one working man trying to build a better life for himself, I don't want to shop at the expense of someone else. I had a difficult time finding information, but I'm kind of in a tricky spot as I lost some weight and need something in my closet. But if you're looking for quality that lasts and looks good, this shirt delivers. Try one or two first, and if it feels great, go for it.I'm graduating university soon and hope to make more money where I can buy stuff 100% ethically, so don't think I'll be buying this again unless they make it very transparent where it's coming from. But for interviews or hardworking days when you need something sturdy, I highly recommend this; nothing comes close to bang for buck. If I find out it's ethically made, this will be my first choice for life indefinitely. This is the type of standard quality clothes that were originally held to decades ago.[update: all of my shirts say they're made in Vietnam. I feel it's a step above China and Bangladesh, and the fact that Amazon is putting its name on it, I'm hoping it's at least following stricter labor standards, as there are some good trends in Vietnam humanity speaking. Feel pretty good about buying from them :) Again, typically, I try to buy from the US or Japan, but since I'm on a budget, I am perfectly happy with this and can recommend it to anyone else! changing review to 5/5 stars!]",ive worn a variety of buttonup shirts over the years from prada to carhartt for different occasions – from operas to bluecollar work let me tell you this right now this shirt can work for just about any occasionwhat i love about it the fit feel and durability i lost a good amount of weight and needed to size down i tried a few amazon brands and one black shirt really stood out its this model ive had it for about a year machinewashed and dried it regularly and it still looks as good as new i bought another one a couple months later  its  cotton which i love for its breathability but it does wrinkle a bit usually its a trade off in shirts but again amazing feel its fairly light so definitely layer up if its cold i wore a merino wool base layer underneath and holy guacamole was i comfortable although it is long sleeve it might not keep you the warmest alone but if you use it in the springsummer youre going to love it when i used it for working on my dads farm i honestly didnt care about the wrinkles but it was never terrible wrinkling in fact i got the sleeves hemmed and noticed the wringling on the sleeves is minimal compared to how it was prior so be prepared to stop by the tailor if youre on the shorter side for that perfect fit def worth it though if you ever want to use it for an interview or something this might not be ideal but definitely can pass if you hang it in the shower to steam and can impress if you take the time to iron and starche it im on the shorter side so i usually rolled up the sleeves to avoid wrinkling prior to getting them alteredim  and am just got the sleeves hemmed i love this shirt so much i bought multiple so itll be nice having more colors in my wardrobe that are good quality and fit well im a fan of the pocket too even though i dont use it muchnow heres the thing i dont like and its not what youd expect have you ever heard of an expression something along the lines of if youre not paying for it someone else is in regards to fast fashion like shein and suchits the ethical aspect – i dont know who made this shirt or the conditions they worked in im hoping the quality speaks for itself as this is far from the fast fashion quality you see in modern clothes nowadays the price isnt terribly cheapbut still it could be made by kids in the same environment as those old nike documentaries ive shifted to buying from countries where i know workers arent exploited such as in the usa or japan as one working man trying to build a better life for himself i dont want to shop at the expense of someone else i had a difficult time finding information but im kind of in a tricky spot as i lost some weight and need something in my closet but if youre looking for quality that lasts and looks good this shirt delivers try one or two first and if it feels great go for itim graduating university soon and hope to make more money where i can buy stuff  ethically so dont think ill be buying this again unless they make it very transparent where its coming from but for interviews or hardworking days when you need something sturdy i highly recommend this nothing comes close to bang for buck if i find out its ethically made this will be my first choice for life indefinitely this is the type of standard quality clothes that were originally held to decades agoupdate all of my shirts say theyre made in vietnam i feel its a step above china and bangladesh and the fact that amazon is putting its name on it im hoping its at least following stricter labor standards as there are some good trends in vietnam humanity speaking feel pretty good about buying from them  again typically i try to buy from the us or japan but since im on a budget i am perfectly happy with this and can recommend it to anyone else changing review to  stars,1

"**Title: A Game Changer for Foot Support and Comfort!**I recently purchased the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 shoes, and I can't express enough how impressed I am with their performance. As someone who has struggled with plantar fasciitis and shin splints, finding the right pair of shoes has been a challenge. However, the GTS 24 has been a true game changer.First and foremost, the support these shoes provide is exceptional. The cushioning is perfectly balanced, allowing for a soft landing while still offering the stability needed for my arches. I noticed a significant reduction in foot pain during and after my walks, which has made a world of difference.Comfort is another highlight. The moment I slipped them on, I could feel how well they hugged my feet without being restrictive. The breathable material keeps my feet cool, and the overall fit is just right. I can wear them for long periods without any discomfort, which is a huge plus.Considering the price, I believe the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 24 is worth every penny. The quality and performance far exceed what I've experienced with other brands at a similar price point. If you're dealing with foot issues like plantar fasciitis or shin splints, I highly recommend giving these shoes a try.Overall, I would rate these shoes a solid 5 stars!

"‚úçÔ∏è The COOFANDY Men's Polo Shirt is a fantastic blend of style, comfort, and affordability, making it a great choice for casual or smart-casual occasions. Made from 100% polyester, the shirt is lightweight, breathable, and moisture-wicking, ideal for warmer weather or active wear. The fit is slim but not clingy, with shorter sleeves that hug the upper arms, giving it a tailored and modern look. The collar is well-constructed and adds a polished touch without being overbearing.The shirt‚Äôs material is cool to the touch and resists wrinkling, making it easy to maintain. The color options, like light blue, dark gray, and wine red, are vibrant and true to the product photos.

"I've been wearing these shoes for years. The first time I've tried them, i got hooked by how comfortable they are. i have no issue wearing them all day. They are great. They generally last for a little over 6 months. But these are very hard months. I work in a heavy duty diesel repair shop, and these guys take a lot of abuse. I've been through about 4 pairs of these shoes.The soles are strong. Generally i don't replace my shoes because the soles are worn, except for one pair at around the year mark. that's not bad.The inside cushion is awesome. This tends to wear out about 6months in. Either the top layer comes off, or the foam is not longer returning to original shape.The ankle cushion also wears at about the 6 month mark. This is generally what causes me to replace my shoes. The shaper for the ankle cushion, in the back is hard, and once the cushion wears, it does dig into the back of my foot a little bit.When you get them on sale for 40+ bucks, that's the best. i try not to buy them at their regular price of over $60. I wish they had these exact shoes with a slightly higher profile around the ankle. I don't like the full ankle support ones. but these offer no ankle protection at all.

If you’ve read some reviews for this product many mentioned the button hole to button mismatch and it’s true. The button is the usual size but the button hole is too small for it. It was either cut it big or send them back. I cut it and that works but I am suspecting the cut will eventually fray as where you cut is no longer sewed. The fabric is nice and the permanent crease is there to stay.In addition to the button hole issue is size. The waist is adjustable and works well though it is a little tight for a 34” waist. You must expand it to the max so no room for growth. The length is not generous. 1/2” shorter and my ankles would show. Why do they not make 31” lengths. Every brand jumps from  30” right to 32”. I’m a 31”.

"Ordered these for my loved one who faces a 5-week of bed or couch rest following surgery. It's a great way to avoid having to do laundry, especially if someone will be recovering part of the time by themselves. The same benefit would apply to travelers. The underwear is made of a thicker material than expected. The socks are a little thin but my guy's not going to be moving around on them anyway. It's mainly to keep his feet warm. The sizes for larger men are very welcome. And if you're super cheap, you could probably hand wash both items for quite a few times before they were unusual.

"I'm 5'11, 185 lbs give or take. My last few pairs of jeans I purchased from a western style boot store and paid considerably more for them than I paid for these. I've been wearing them a couple years now and one of the pairs, although still fit good, are getting too short so I decided to try these as a replacement. When this pair arrived I tried them on and first thought was to return them because they seemed a bit too long (I go from one extreme to the other). I decided to try them with my roper boots, which is what I'd mostly be wearing them for, and they actually didn't look too bad at all. I threw them in the wash and tried them again and they were better. Honestly, I believe they're designed that way on purpose hence boot cut. Lol the back of the pants by the heal ride lower than I've been accustomed to but in no way touch the ground; the front drape over as they should. I'm confident as they go through more washes they won't be too short. I don't envision wearing these with any other shoes aside from my roper boots but tried them with my low cut converse and they're certainly doable. They seem like better jeans material than the pairs from the western store and, like I said, cost considerably less. Waist, etc. fit great. A great boot jean for a great price. I dig them. The pockets are deeper/better than the the high priced jeans, as well. I could never figure out why the pockets in those jeans seemed so shallow. If my cell phone wasn't a flip phone it'd barely fit.

Without including a picture of how the company does measurements I used the traditional tailor method. This seemed to be inaccurate especially with the sleeve length as I have a 25 inch sleeve so I selected the size that correlates with this.

"I really like the fit and feel of this coat. It is very cozy and allows for good movement and layered clothing under it. I’m 5-10”, 215 lbs, somewhat broad shoulders and dad-bod belly. I ordered an XXL and I’m glad I did. I would much rather have a slightly large coat than one which binds in any way. The sleeves are about 1.5” too long without adjustment, but again, better than too short. I like the length as well, how it falls lower on hips at about the length of an untucked shirt. This coat (I selected black) is very stylish as well as warm, without having to be puffy. I like that it does not have a hood also. I’m not sure if it would be the best outdoor work jacket in frigid temps, but that’s probably not what most guys would expect in this one. It simply feels great on my body and looks dressy enough for date nights, etc. I don’t mind that it has snap buttons instead of a zipper. This detail kind of makes it a sharper looking coat, in fact. I usually leave coats open in front anyway, unless it’s exceptionally  cold out.A couple of things could improve this garment. The inside pocket (with Velcro closure) should be deeper to accommodate a cell phone better. Come on, everyone carries a phone and this detail would go a long way. Secondly, who thought the “Fashion Sport” patch on the sleeve would appeal to anyone? The leather-look patch itself looks okay, but put a duck or something generic on it. At least it’s not so glaring as to be a deal breaker. I can live with it.In closing, I’ll just say if you are a husky guy with a bit of a ponch belly, about 220-260 lbs, don’t have very short arms, and like freedom of movement, I believe you’ll like the XXL size. $70 seems fair for this nice coat.",i really like the fit and feel of this coat it is very cozy and allows for good movement and layered clothing under it i’m ”  lbs somewhat broad shoulders and dadbod belly i ordered an xxl and i’m glad i did i would much rather have a slightly large coat than one which binds in any way the sleeves are about ” too long without adjustment but again better than too short i like the length as well how it falls lower on hips at about the length of an untucked shirt this coat i selected black is very stylish as well as warm without having to be puffy i like that it does not have a hood also i’m not sure if it would be the best outdoor work jacket in frigid temps but that’s probably not what most guys would expect in this one it simply feels great on my body and looks dressy enough for date nights etc i don’t mind that it has snap buttons instead of a zipper this detail kind of makes it a sharper looking coat in fact i usually leave coats open in front anyway unless it’s exceptionally  cold outa couple of things could improve this garment the inside pocket with velcro closure should be deeper to accommodate a cell phone better come on everyone carries a phone and this detail would go a long way secondly who thought the “fashion sport” patch on the sleeve would appeal to anyone the leatherlook patch itself looks okay but put a duck or something generic on it at least it’s not so glaring as to be a deal breaker i can live with itin closing i’ll just say if you are a husky guy with a bit of a ponch belly about  lbs don’t have very short arms and like freedom of movement i believe you’ll like the xxl size  seems fair for this nice coat,1

"Up front: I have MS (suffer from foot drop), Iâ€™m not super athletic, but I walk regularly. I wasnâ€™t looking for anything for the gym, just a solid shoe to walk my dog. High arch, bridge of my foot is wide (on clouds almost cut off my circulation before I broke them in).Adidas are my go-to, I love the way they hug my feet, size is always spot on. Iâ€™ve had the dirty blue on clouds (right shoe obviously) for 4 years now and kinda let them get worn out. Was lucky enough to find a cute pair of adidas in my size but wasnâ€™t sure the color would go with jeans and workout apparel. Theyâ€™re NOT as purple as they look in the ad, very subtle.

"My boyfriend usually wears 34/32, and both L & XL fit him just the way he wanted them to fit. He wears Large when he is outside, and changes into XL when he gets home for more relaxed fit. The length is just right.We got these in three different colors: Green, DarkGrey, and Beige, and all colors were a very close match to what they are on Amazon pictures.  The fabric is breathable, very comfortable, looks and feels a lot like linen (but it's a very nice mix).

"I spent a lot of time trying to figure out what size to order and I ended up going with the large tall. It fits extremely well.

True to size. My husband is 5'9 and 165. Slim athletic build. Medium fits like a tailored shirt. I'm impressed.It was packaged well and a wee bit wrinkled upon arrival (to be expected).Washed according to label instructions - cold gentle cycle by itself (with ECOS Liquid Laundry Detergent) and dried with a few soft towels on low heat for about 15 minutes.It was wrinkle free and gorgeous when I took it out of the dryer. Wow!I can't express how much I hate ironing unless I have to. If I spend 10 mins per week ironing a dress shirt * 52 Sundays - that is 520 minutes or 8.66 hours per year. And it still won't look as perfect as this shirt. NO MORE IRONING!!!My husband looks awesome in this shirt - so much so that we quickly purchased another. He also didn't think the button holes were weird (as some other reviews mentioned).Great value & nicely priced.,true to size my husband is  and  slim athletic build medium fits like a tailored shirt im impressedit was packaged well and a wee bit wrinkled upon arrival to be expectedwashed according to label instructions  cold gentle cycle by itself with ecos liquid laundry detergent and dried with a few soft towels on low heat for about  minutesit was wrinkle free and gorgeous when i took it out of the dryer wowi cant express how much i hate ironing unless i have to if i spend  mins per week ironing a dress shirt   sundays  that is  minutes or  hours per year and it still wont look as perfect as this shirt no more ironingmy husband looks awesome in this shirt  so much so that we quickly purchased another he also didnt think the button holes were weird as some other reviews mentionedgreat value  nicely priced,1

"I was initially skeptical about Coofandy due to the extensive publicity and the use of top models who make everything look amazing. Additionally, the mixed reviews about product quality made me hesitant. Having never purchased a shirt from them before, I was unsure about the sizing, especially since the models, who appeared more muscular than me, often wore size M, while I typically wear size L.With an upcoming vacation and a desire for stylish beachwear, I decided to take a chance on Coofandy’shirts that I could wear with a Panama hat. So I decided to order this light green linen shirt size L (I am 168 cm, 5 ft 6 inches tall, 87 kg/191.8 pounds, with a chest measurement of 43 and shoulders 19.5). To my pleasant surprise, the experience was fantastic. The size was true to my measurements, despite the somewhat misleading size chart and the significant margin of error they mention (up to 3 cm!).The quality of the shirt is superior, trendy, and fits me perfectly. The fabric is light, not hot and it's going to feels nice while at the hot beach weather. The color is not so green as in the photos on the website, but still is pleasant. I am thoroughly satisfied with Coofandy and highly recommend their products. However, I do suggest that the company provide more detailed information about the models’ measurements to better guide customers in their choices. Thank you, Coofandy!

Then I look at my closet recently and decide it's time to get rid of some stuff I'm not wearing and look just a tad sharper.

Terrific fit, super comfortable right out of the box, looks perfect, and only 35 bucks or so for the pair.

"So I saw some reviews saying they were heavy for running shorts. Quite frankly, I’m not a huge runner, so I couldn’t care less or know even how to compare them to running shorts properly but I would say if you are a serious runner these may not be for you if the weight matters because yes they feel heavy when I hold them. But I have taken them for runs and if you are just in it for the exercise you wouldn’t notice anything from that side.They are actually way more comfortable than I had expected so I have bought another. They are quickly becoming my favorite lounging shorts.My only real issue, which stopped me from giving this a 5 star, is that while they fit nicely, they do lack on the waist support. To explain, I am wearing a XXL and while it does have a drawstring, it isn’t super long which for me makes it tough to get them good a snug around my waist. Admittedly, at a XXL I don’t exactly have a runners physique which could explain why they don’t fit me perfectly. But still, I have run with them and haven’t had any accidental flashing in public so should be great for most casual athletes or people just looking for a comfy pair of shorts.",so i saw some reviews saying they were heavy for running shorts quite frankly i’m not a huge runner so i couldn’t care less or know even how to compare them to running shorts properly but i would say if you are a serious runner these may not be for you if the weight matters because yes they feel heavy when i hold them but i have taken them for runs and if you are just in it for the exercise you wouldn’t notice anything from that sidethey are actually way more comfortable than i had expected so i have bought another they are quickly becoming my favorite lounging shortsmy only real issue which stopped me from giving this a  star is that while they fit nicely they do lack on the waist support to explain i am wearing a xxl and while it does have a drawstring it isn’t super long which for me makes it tough to get them good a snug around my waist admittedly at a xxl i don’t exactly have a runners physique which could explain why they don’t fit me perfectly but still i have run with them and haven’t had any accidental flashing in public so should be great for most casual athletes or people just looking for a comfy pair of shorts,1

"I loved the style and the fit. I had been looking for a shacket for a few months and ran across this one and the concealed carry one just like it. I saved it and looked around but to no avail. Im 6'4 usually around 220lbs and built a little bit weird i guess. I can never find shirts long enough but i wear a 34 length in jeans. I ordered the CQA brand similar to this legendary white tails and it said the length was long but it wasn't long enough so i sold it to my cousin and ordered this 1 and the length is perfect. Its so hard to find jackets for myself. This is light but not to light and paired with a hoodie would be really warm. Its not gna be terribly warm by itself but i got it for work. I drive a lift in a warehouse and load trucks on the dock and running up into the semi trailers can get very cold in the winter but if i had to be outside this by itself would not be enough. For me though this is perfect so i dont get to hot in a bigger jacket or coat and company policy we can't wear anything with hoods.  So this was the choice for me. Mine came in perfect condition from what i can see. No rips, no buttons off. Everything as shown and should be. I will update this review in time after a few weeks of wearing it.",i loved the style and the fit i had been looking for a shacket for a few months and ran across this one and the concealed carry one just like it i saved it and looked around but to no avail im  usually around lbs and built a little bit weird i guess i can never find shirts long enough but i wear a  length in jeans i ordered the cqa brand similar to this legendary white tails and it said the length was long but it wasnt long enough so i sold it to my cousin and ordered this  and the length is perfect its so hard to find jackets for myself this is light but not to light and paired with a hoodie would be really warm its not gna be terribly warm by itself but i got it for work i drive a lift in a warehouse and load trucks on the dock and running up into the semi trailers can get very cold in the winter but if i had to be outside this by itself would not be enough for me though this is perfect so i dont get to hot in a bigger jacket or coat and company policy we cant wear anything with hoods  so this was the choice for me mine came in perfect condition from what i can see no rips no buttons off everything as shown and should be i will update this review in time after a few weeks of wearing it,1
"I ordered 2 pairs, hoping the size would work for me but with low expectations. Just tried them on and quite pleased! Waist and length were very good. Although I haven't with them out yet, the material seems to have just enough stretch and is a light to medium weight that I hope will be comfortable on warm days. The waist band has two subtle rubberized bands that should help shirts stay tucked in, something I struggle with. My only question is on a shadow, narrow side pocket next to the right front pocket. I'm not sure what it might be useful for, maybe a ball marker. I wish it had a little more volume to it. But for the value, these look to be a winner overall and I would easily recommend giving them a try.",i ordered  pairs hoping the size would work for me but with low expectations just tried them on and quite pleased waist and length were very good although i havent with them out yet the material seems to have just enough stretch and is a light to medium weight that i hope will be comfortable on warm days the waist band has two subtle rubberized bands that should help shirts stay tucked in something i struggle with my only question is on a shadow narrow side pocket next to the right front pocket im not sure what it might be useful for maybe a ball marker i wish it had a little more volume to it but for the value these look to be a winner overall and i would easily recommend giving them a try,1

"These are great underwear! I personally wear a 3XL and I have never been able to find a pair of Underwear that fits well and has a lasting quality. Usually underwear have been too loose on my legs and would  uncomfortably ride up causing a wedgie or are too short and tight on my waist. But these underwear are PERFECT! They stay snug and breathable on your legs, have a tall fit on the waist with enough elastic to stay up but not enough to leave uncomfortable marks. And another great thing is no Brand tags so you don’t have to worry about scratchy threads in the front or back. These are made for those who want to stay idle on a relaxing day or exercise vigorously. I have gone on 3 mile Hikes, danced for Ballet Folklorico performances and dressed Formally for parties. In all cases these under garments have given me a comfortable and relaxed feeling with the confidence of knowing I won’t have to do an awkward side shuffle or embarrassing readjustment.

Staticky ?  I’m not a fan of in any way.  Wore the shirt to work, it was soft and comfortable.  No static detected.  Winter coat and sweatshirt on and off was the real test.  No static cling for the entire day.  The shirt was comfortable and I’m really happy with the purchase.  I purchased another 5 shirts different colors.  So now I’m all set.  I did the dryer test as well.  No shrinking detected.  lol.  I will hang them though just because they dry fast.  But it’s a nice shirt.  Good for work or a night out on town.  Again.

WATCH THE SIZING. In pants like this, I normally wear a large (36 waist, 32 inseam) and T, without looking at the sizing chart, ordered a set in my size. They fit great upon arrival, even after the first few washes if I tumble dried or air dried them. After 1 heated dry cycle....the pants are...more form fitting than desired. Yes, they have a high cotton content, yes it was my error, but they feel as if they have shrunk a full size and a half to two sizes.Anyways, I recommend sizing up from your norm and dry away.

"Definitely love how it fits. I normally run a medium, but with this shirt it’s more of a small fits. The best for me in the look I know tactical shirts usually run a little bit bigger for more of the support, but knowing that this material is like way easy to pack up the colors very vibrant. It doesn’t weigh that much. You can’t see through it, when I’m walking around, I don’t feel like people are judging me for the defensiveness in my clothes that most tactical gears give off . When you’re just searching for a great value For your money And Durability that’s why I go for more tactical options. The shirt fits nicely to my more slimmer waist and more broader shoulders..

"One of the standout features of the Skechers Moreno is its Air-Cooled Memory Foam insole, which provides excellent cushioning and support. The shoe feels soft and responsive underfoot, making it perfect for all-day wear. They fit true to size. They felt slightly snug at first—though it stretches out nicely over time.

"These sleeved shirts are a nice shirt of medium quality. I purchased three different colors. They look very nice on, drape well and the colors are good, but not a deep color. They are comfortable, the quality is good for casual wear, but the material is not my favorite blend. The material is thin, but not super thin--so not a hot garment--soft enough, but not cozy soft.The sizing and fit are good, but if you want a relaxed fit, size up. Moreover, the flared stitching on the chest and slightly puffed sleeve at the cuff is really complimentary. Nice.Lastly, I have warn and washed them without issues.

"I recently picked up the OYGSieg 5 Pack Men's Polo Shirts, and I'm genuinely impressed with the value and performance they offer. If you're looking for comfortable, quick-drying polos that can handle everything from a round of golf to a casual day out, these are worth considering.Pros:Excellent Value: Getting five polo shirts for the price is fantastic. It's an economical way to build a versatile wardrobe.Quick-Drying and Performance Fabric: The material is lightweight and breathable, making it ideal for warm weather or active pursuits. The quick-dry feature is a major plus, keeping you comfortable even when you sweat.Comfortable Fit: The shirts fit true to size and offer a relaxed yet stylish look. They don't feel restrictive, allowing for a full range of motion.Versatile Style: These polos can easily transition from the golf course to casual outings. They look neat and presentable, making them suitable for various occasions.Tactical/Sporty Look: The shirts have a modern, slightly sporty aesthetic that many will find appealing.Color Variety: The 5 pack offers a nice variety of colors, allowing you to mix and match with different outfits.Easy Care: They wash well and maintain their shape and color after multiple washes.Cons:Material Feel: While the performance fabric is functional, some might find it slightly less luxurious than traditional cotton polos. It has a more synthetic/heavier feel.Thinness of Fabric: While good for quick drying, the fabric is on the heavier side. This might be a concern for those who prefer a more minimal polo.Potential for Wrinkling: While they are fairly wrinkle resistant, if left in the dryer for too long, some wrinkles may occur. It is best to remove them promptly.Simple Collar: The collar is functional, but it is a fairly basic collar, and not a reinforced or overly structured collar.Overall:The OYGSieg 5 Pack Men's Polo Shirts are a great buy for anyone who prioritizes comfort, performance, and value. They are perfect for active individuals, golfers, or anyone who wants a reliable and affordable set of polo shirts. While the material might not have the same luxurious feel as higher-end polos, the functionality and price point make them a worthwhile investment.

"So I've gone through a couple of different mens peacoat brands and style, having returned each because of inaccurate size or quality of material not being worth the money spent. However, I took a chance on this brand and ONLY after doing careful research by reading customer reviews and seeing how the coat looked on each individual... I took my last gamble and it paid off big time! So I'm 5'10 and have a slim/muscular frame and after trying it on... It fit perfectly. It's not baggy nor is it too tight where I can't button it up. Granted... I won't wear sweaters or bulky shirts because that's where it'll become constricted. The lining is thin, too, so it's good for Autumn or warm winter conditions. One of the best parts I like is that this coat runs in length like a quarter trench coat so it hangs by my mid thigh.. Let's just say I've been looking for a quarter trench peacoat and I happened to win big with this selection, yet again! As far as quality, it definitely is wool blend with a softer side to the wool so it's not itchy or coarse to the touch. If your looking for a fashionable coat that'll make you look made... I'd definitely recommend this coat.",so ive gone through a couple of different mens peacoat brands and style having returned each because of inaccurate size or quality of material not being worth the money spent however i took a chance on this brand and only after doing careful research by reading customer reviews and seeing how the coat looked on each individual i took my last gamble and it paid off big time so im  and have a slimmuscular frame and after trying it on it fit perfectly its not baggy nor is it too tight where i cant button it up granted i wont wear sweaters or bulky shirts because thats where itll become constricted the lining is thin too so its good for autumn or warm winter conditions one of the best parts i like is that this coat runs in length like a quarter trench coat so it hangs by my mid thigh lets just say ive been looking for a quarter trench peacoat and i happened to win big with this selection yet again as far as quality it definitely is wool blend with a softer side to the wool so its not itchy or coarse to the touch if your looking for a fashionable coat thatll make you look made id definitely recommend this coat,1

"The situation:My son's school requires their sweaters to match the uniform shirts and each grade has a specific color. 5th grade's white, 8th grade's navy. Easy peasy!But 7th grade? Baby Blue.

Throw in my neurodivergent kid (ADHD) that's fussy over certain fabrics, it's a bit more difficult. ðŸ¥´The overall:For us, this was a bit baggy but he likes it that way. He's a skinny, shorter 13yo (we're Southeast Asian). The pocket is big enough to hold a smartphone but not quite snug enough to keep it from falling out. There are NO DRAWSTRINGS on the hood but he doesn't use them anyhow. And they always get lost in this family. Oh and it came a little bit snagged at the wrist. Pic included.The material is thin enough for him to wear on sunny autumn days but thick enough to protect him from a drizzle. It can be layered easily because it isn't too thick, which is useful for him since he always needs a winter coat.It's quite soft out of the package, so it might wear out quicker than one that's thicker and a bit more factory fresh, but that's okay with us. It's only a school year.

"The pictures after after quite a few shifts so they aren’t “brand new” and are a little dirty. I am a Brooks believer. Haha okay no but these really are nice shoes. I like Brooks shoes but not all of them feel comfortable to me. I wear a size 8 in most shoes and these are no different size-wise. At first I put them on and it felt like there was too much foam around my achilles tendon area and my foot was too high inside the shoes but it quickly softened and felt nice, snug and supportive. I have a wide foot and high arch. I will say there isn’t a high arch in this shoe but it still feels like I have good arch support.

"It's stylish, warm, soft (especially the liner), and it's highly functional...meaning that unlike a lot of jackets with a bunch of apparent buttons and pockets, every single button can be unbuttoned and every pocket is an actual pocket.

Been meaning to swing this jacket by a tailor sometime to make sure they can remove the patches without damaging the jacket.  It's not a huge deal so I haven't done that yet, but if I can get these patches off then it's definitely one of my top two or three jackets I've owned.Seriously everything else about the jacket feels premium and I'm surprised it wasn't double the price for the quality.Also because it's so big/soft/warm, it's a great jacket to pull out when you're hanging out with the girlfriend who inevitably gets cold and asks for a jacket.

"The quality of the fabric is cheap, but I think that is what also makes it a nice casual summer dress. It's light and flowy, but not see through at all. The fit is true to size if not even a bit generous. I'm a bit nervous about washing it the first time and several reviewers have said that their dress did not survive the washing process or shrunk, even when hand-washing.  I deducted a star because I think it is way overpriced. This is really a $25 dress considering the low quality of the material, it's lack of durability and poor stitching.

"These pants are comfortable and stylish. They're perfect for summer outings when you want to dress up a bit but not be sweltering in the sun. Unfortunately, the craftsmanship left much to be desired. One of the buttons came free in the wash (I had yet to wear them for more than the two minutes it took to try them on). I then discovered a hole in one of the pockets. I happen to have the skills to fix both the button and the pocket, and it would take me far less time to do so than it would to bother with a return, but it is certainly not ideal.

"Extremely happy with my purchase. The coat looks great and looks of decent quality for the price. It's nice to be able to stay outside the $200-$400 higher side coat price range and get something that looks good and fashionable. I rotate clothes a lot, so having several winter coat options at more reasonable prices fits the bill perfectly, just as this coat does. And, at the price, if can get 1 or 1.5 seasons wear, I'm happy.As for coat fit, I'm 6'3, 34x34 pant, 15 1/2 neck, 36 sleeve, 40 chest, 175 lbs, more triangular build. The large fits a bit loose at top, but that's my issue as I prefer a bit tighter fitting clothing. So, not a manufacturer problem in my opinion as some online clothes can be. More so, I wouldn't downsize due to the sleeve length which was absolutely perfect. And, above all, the extra size accommodation at top, of course, is likely given to accommodate a suit/sport coat underneath. And, while peoples suit/sport coats length can vary, if my suit/sport coat is buttoned, this coat covers such an undercoat just fine. If the suit/sport coat is unbuttoned, that coat hangs a bit out from underneath from this coat. Not an issue. Just FYI. And, with my preference for likely wearing with just a sweater, this size will be great and as tailored to one as one can expect from ordering online.I ordered the coffee 01 color, and no disappointment there. What I saw in the pictures, is what I got. I was worried the blend might look a bit cheesy. But, no. Very refined looking and just the color I wanted.Some people said they didn't like the buttons, that they are maybe a bit flashy, i.e., not just solid color or standard brown/black. If you are way conservative in dressing, or need that, perhaps so. I get it. But, I think they are a nice accent. I worried a bit about that too. But, when I got the coat. Not a problem at all. Looks great and if a real concern I think the coat is worth it to have a tailor put on the buttons you want.Last, there seems to be a bit of confusion on the reviews as to whether its too short or that its more of a waist coat. Yes, this version is. For me, it fits more to my upper thigh, or right at mid-point on pants pockets. HOWEVER!!!, within the color options, different lengths are presented, so beware! And that is perhaps what people are noting. One color you like, might be a different coat style/length than another color you like. So, carefully read the description and look at the sleeve bottom to coat bottom ratio in the pictures for length approximation or read the size charts, which I think pretty accurately depict the difference.I picked up on this difference and decided to also order a longer length coat in another color by this manufacturer, in case the first didn't seem to fit as I wanted. I am keeping both! as these are really decent wardrobe additions and each of the lengths I thought I was picking is exactly what I got. One other point on some of the comments, this coat did come with a scarf. The other coat under this manufacturer that I got with the listing shown to come with a scarf, did not. So people have noted this. Perhaps true. But, in seeing that possibility ahead of time before ordering, I knew scarf or no scarf was not going to be a deal breaker at this price. Also, I believe some folk contacted the manufacturer and got the scarf separately. Again, not a deal breaker for my purpose.Anyhow, long review....but I was really impressed with the coat(s) from this brand/manufacturer. In buying 2 at still a fraction of a $400 single coat price, I can rotate and likely get better dress options and similar wear, and I will look for this seller's clothing in the future.",extremely happy with my purchase the coat looks great and looks of decent quality for the price its nice to be able to stay outside the  higher side coat price range and get something that looks good and fashionable i rotate clothes a lot so having several winter coat options at more reasonable prices fits the bill perfectly just as this coat does and at the price if can get  or  seasons wear im happyas for coat fit im  x pant   neck  sleeve  chest  lbs more triangular build the large fits a bit loose at top but thats my issue as i prefer a bit tighter fitting clothing so not a manufacturer problem in my opinion as some online clothes can be more so i wouldnt downsize due to the sleeve length which was absolutely perfect and above all the extra size accommodation at top of course is likely given to accommodate a suitsport coat underneath and while peoples suitsport coats length can vary if my suitsport coat is buttoned this coat covers such an undercoat just fine if the suitsport coat is unbuttoned that coat hangs a bit out from underneath from this coat not an issue just fyi and with my preference for likely wearing with just a sweater this size will be great and as tailored to one as one can expect from ordering onlinei ordered the coffee  color and no disappointment there what i saw in the pictures is what i got i was worried the blend might look a bit cheesy but no very refined looking and just the color i wantedsome people said they didnt like the buttons that they are maybe a bit flashy ie not just solid color or standard brownblack if you are way conservative in dressing or need that perhaps so i get it but i think they are a nice accent i worried a bit about that too but when i got the coat not a problem at all looks great and if a real concern i think the coat is worth it to have a tailor put on the buttons you wantlast there seems to be a bit of confusion on the reviews as to whether its too short or that its more of a waist coat yes this version is for me it fits more to my upper thigh or right at midpoint on pants pockets however within the color options different lengths are presented so beware and that is perhaps what people are noting one color you like might be a different coat stylelength than another color you like so carefully read the description and look at the sleeve bottom to coat bottom ratio in the pictures for length approximation or read the size charts which i think pretty accurately depict the differencei picked up on this difference and decided to also order a longer length coat in another color by this manufacturer in case the first didnt seem to fit as i wanted i am keeping both as these are really decent wardrobe additions and each of the lengths i thought i was picking is exactly what i got one other point on some of the comments this coat did come with a scarf the other coat under this manufacturer that i got with the listing shown to come with a scarf did not so people have noted this perhaps true but in seeing that possibility ahead of time before ordering i knew scarf or no scarf was not going to be a deal breaker at this price also i believe some folk contacted the manufacturer and got the scarf separately again not a deal breaker for my purposeanyhow long reviewbut i was really impressed with the coats from this brandmanufacturer in buying  at still a fraction of a  single coat price i can rotate and likely get better dress options and similar wear and i will look for this sellers clothing in the future,1

"These shorts are a great quality. I highly recommend to making sure is measured accordingly. Some children waist are just so small. It fit my child kind of big so I just kept it for later. As I look back, I made a good choice because he is now growing into it for the following summer. This is awesome to get a few in different sizes if you are a parent or grandparent who shop based on cost effectiveness and the timing of growth and change of child. I personally dislike wasting money on clothes children grow out in short time. This product met my need.The delivery was so fancy in regards to care of product. Shorts were presented in a plastic apparel wrapping and put in a discreet Amazon packaging as well. This fitted well to withstand climates like snow or rain. My package was clean and dry.

You know the expression “it’s like walking on a cloud?” Well these really are like that. The most comfortable shoe I have ever owned. I have only one negative thing to say. Be careful with color choice. I bought the grey/black/green color. It shows dirt immediately. And the dirt is VERY noticeable. I have to wash these every 2-3 wearings. I think it says not to machine wash these. So I hand wash them. A little Dawn PowerWash and a dampened cloth works well.,you know the expression “it’s like walking on a cloud” well these really are like that the most comfortable shoe i have ever owned i have only one negative thing to say be careful with color choice i bought the greyblackgreen color it shows dirt immediately and the dirt is very noticeable i have to wash these every  wearings i think it says not to machine wash these so i hand wash them a little dawn powerwash and a dampened cloth works well,1

"These athletic shorts are great for running, working out, or playing sports. They are very breathable, comfortable, and look great. However, I am giving them 4 stars instead of 5 because of the side pockets. I find the pockets to be a little too far back on the shorts, which makes them difficult to access quickly. The side pockets are located on the exact middle side seams of the shorts, and the openings are a straight line down. Now, this is an issue because it means I have to move my arm back more to access them, and the straighter opening is not as easy to access as a diagonal opening. The other athletic shorts I own have pockets closer to the front and have a diagonal opening, so you can easily use them, whereas these shorts do not. Now, I am unsure if that made sense, but if it did and they improve the pockets later on, then these shorts would be a 5/5. Overall, the shorts are made from a great material, they are comfortable, breathable, and look great. I just wish the pockets were easier to access and the pocket opening was at an angle, but besides that, these shorts are excellent!",these athletic shorts are great for running working out or playing sports they are very breathable comfortable and look great however i am giving them  stars instead of  because of the side pockets i find the pockets to be a little too far back on the shorts which makes them difficult to access quickly the side pockets are located on the exact middle side seams of the shorts and the openings are a straight line down now this is an issue because it means i have to move my arm back more to access them and the straighter opening is not as easy to access as a diagonal opening the other athletic shorts i own have pockets closer to the front and have a diagonal opening so you can easily use them whereas these shorts do not now i am unsure if that made sense but if it did and they improve the pockets later on then these shorts would be a  overall the shorts are made from a great material they are comfortable breathable and look great i just wish the pockets were easier to access and the pocket opening was at an angle but besides that these shorts are excellent,1

Very comfortable, no binding in the crotch, price is right, fit is perfect/true to size.

"Husband Review.OK all really starting to really like COOFANDY. Have other products (shirts) of theirs so I'm not new to the brand.  Just got these pants in the dark tan, perfect fit and length! (as usual) Deep front and back pockets and imagine, back pockets with buttons! Defiantly a good thing for out and about dancing whatever on a beach resort in Mexico, maybe even out in town. Further, the elastic is solid. Has a good draw string, and wow, look at that belt loops! These pants are far superior to other brands as I have discovered thus far. And guess what? They don't shrink three inches in cold water and air dried! Now HERE IS THE DEAL....these aren't linen! Like a lot of people seem to thing, but have the look and feel of quality linen, but without the shrinkage. Cons...meah, slightly more tapered at the leg, but then its resort wear so casual is what's the haps. I might argue for one more inch at the hem, but it still clear the ankle. Pros...Fit/Size perfect. I am a 36w X 32L and that's exactly what I got with room to spare or shrink, preferably shrink a bit. Multiple colors, not just tan, white, blue. Looks great rolled up or with deck shoes. To conclude, this is a good solid buy. And much more economical that other linen brands. Looking forwards to seeing how well they wear and last. I'm kind of a clothes snob, but like putting together outfits that are cheap but look amazing. So giving this a 5 star rating for looks, fitting, versatility, and most defiantly cost.",husband reviewok all really starting to really like coofandy have other products shirts of theirs so im not new to the brand  just got these pants in the dark tan perfect fit and length as usual deep front and back pockets and imagine back pockets with buttons defiantly a good thing for out and about dancing whatever on a beach resort in mexico maybe even out in town further the elastic is solid has a good draw string and wow look at that belt loops these pants are far superior to other brands as i have discovered thus far and guess what they dont shrink three inches in cold water and air dried now here is the dealthese arent linen like a lot of people seem to thing but have the look and feel of quality linen but without the shrinkage consmeah slightly more tapered at the leg but then its resort wear so casual is whats the haps i might argue for one more inch at the hem but it still clear the ankle prosfitsize perfect i am a w x l and thats exactly what i got with room to spare or shrink preferably shrink a bit multiple colors not just tan white blue looks great rolled up or with deck shoes to conclude this is a good solid buy and much more economical that other linen brands looking forwards to seeing how well they wear and last im kind of a clothes snob but like putting together outfits that are cheap but look amazing so giving this a  star rating for looks fitting versatility and most defiantly cost,1

"I bought these shorts after reading reviews about their comfort in hot humid climates. I wanted something comfortable but not lightweight. After three weeks in the tropics I can attest that these shorts are the right shorts for the climate. They dry outside in a couple of hours should you need to hand wash and while the cloth is thicker than lightweight fabric, it does not cling to the body. Pockets are generously sized for wallet and phone. The fit is about half size too loose but not an issue as I prefer my clothes baggy. One comment my wife made was that these do not look like the typical old man bulky cargo shorts. This means I can order more.These shorts are perfect for wearing around the city, the beach, light hikes, or inside a non-air conditioned bus. I'm not sure I would use these on any adventurous activity that has the potential to tear fabric. Your experience may be different but based on my experiences, this grade of fabric isn't for adventure.Because of my experience, I definitely would buy these again.",i bought these shorts after reading reviews about their comfort in hot humid climates i wanted something comfortable but not lightweight after three weeks in the tropics i can attest that these shorts are the right shorts for the climate they dry outside in a couple of hours should you need to hand wash and while the cloth is thicker than lightweight fabric it does not cling to the body pockets are generously sized for wallet and phone the fit is about half size too loose but not an issue as i prefer my clothes baggy one comment my wife made was that these do not look like the typical old man bulky cargo shorts this means i can order morethese shorts are perfect for wearing around the city the beach light hikes or inside a nonair conditioned bus im not sure i would use these on any adventurous activity that has the potential to tear fabric your experience may be different but based on my experiences this grade of fabric isnt for adventurebecause of my experience i definitely would buy these again,1

"This is a solid, no-nonsense T-shirt. The fabric is definitely thicker than your average tee, which makes it feel durable, but also a little warm if you’re wearing it in the summer. It holds up well in the wash, though I did notice a bit of shrinking, so maybe size up if you don’t want a snug fit.The cut is a little boxy, which I don’t mind, but it’s not the most stylish fit out there. That said, for $8, it’s a great basic T-shirt that feels like it’ll last longer than the thinner ones that wear out fast.",this is a solid nononsense tshirt the fabric is definitely thicker than your average tee which makes it feel durable but also a little warm if you’re wearing it in the summer it holds up well in the wash though i did notice a bit of shrinking so maybe size up if you don’t want a snug fitthe cut is a little boxy which i don’t mind but it’s not the most stylish fit out there that said for  it’s a great basic tshirt that feels like it’ll last longer than the thinner ones that wear out fast,1

"This is a comfortable, flattering top that fits nicely in my usual size. I can't attest to how well it will hold up over time since I've only washed and worn it once. I wash clothes inside-out, in cold water,  and typically hang shirts to dry so they last, and look new longer. But I understand that's not something everyone wants to make time for.I ordered the color Blue, and it looks exactly as shown in photos of that color. It's worth mentioning I personally don't consider any top a tunic unless it covers my rear when I'm standing, and this does not, so personally I won't wear it with leggings, but it looks cute with jeans. Also worth mentioning... I carry my weight in my butt, hips & thighs, (thanks to family genetics!), so maybe this top would fit more like a tunic for a person who isn't pear shaped like me?I like that this top is dressier than just a simple tee, yet it's comfy for lounging around the house, or wearing to go out to do casual things.",this is a comfortable flattering top that fits nicely in my usual size i cant attest to how well it will hold up over time since ive only washed and worn it once i wash clothes insideout in cold water  and typically hang shirts to dry so they last and look new longer but i understand thats not something everyone wants to make time fori ordered the color blue and it looks exactly as shown in photos of that color its worth mentioning i personally dont consider any top a tunic unless it covers my rear when im standing and this does not so personally i wont wear it with leggings but it looks cute with jeans also worth mentioning i carry my weight in my butt hips  thighs thanks to family genetics so maybe this top would fit more like a tunic for a person who isnt pear shaped like mei like that this top is dressier than just a simple tee yet its comfy for lounging around the house or wearing to go out to do casual things,1

"I am wearing the Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt right now. It has a ribbed collar and flat-seamed sleeves.WHAT I LIKE:The fit is exactly the same as every other Hanes polo I have worn — just order your usual American size. It’s a standard, traditional fit — it isn’t elastic, form-fitting, or clinging. The polyester fabric is very light and cool with a finish that is smooth, not meshy or lumpy. The finish is a little slippery, but that’s not a problem for me. I ordered black, which is very dark and opaque (not see-through). The price was very reasonable.I wash the Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt in biodegradable detergent on regular cycle with tap-cold water and maximum spin, and the shirt comes out wrinkle-free. Then I hang it on a plastic hanger on the shower rod and it is dry in a few hours. So that’s minimal care in my book.If you want to travel with the Hanes shirt, it packs light and hasn’t wrinkled, yet. If you want a shirt you can rinse out and hang up to dry overnight, this is it.WHAT I DON’T LIKE SO WELL:The only thing I don’t like is that the short sleeves are a little long, reaching to the middle of my elbows. I was going to send it back over the sleeves, but trusted advisors tell me that it looks fine. So, if it looks fine, it’s OK with me.DURABILITY:I have been testing my Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt by wearing all the time by itself and under a sweater or jacket for warmth. So far, my shirt has not shrunk, wrinkled, snagged, or pilled — the seams are still sewn tight. I wish I had longer term durability data for you, but then you couldn’t be reading my review now.ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES:Hanes Cool Dri polo shirts are made of synthetic polyester with no elastic fibers (like Lycra or Elastane). Polyester fabric is strong, clean, slightly absorbent, slightly shrinkable, and can be recycled. Lots of polyester is recycled from plastic water bottles, so that’s a good thing. Unfortunately, polyester is not very biodegradable (land fill estimate=100 years), although some bacteria and lichen have been found that degrade them. My Hanes Cool Dri polo shirt was made in El Salvador.RECOMMENDATIONS:Right now, I’m recommending Hanes Cool Dri polo shirts if you want a super light, inexpensive shirt and don’t mind the sleeves a little long. If I change my mind or my Hanes polyester polo develops problems, I’ll publish an UPDATE on my Amazon profile page (just click my name).You’re welcome to read more of my reviews, check for UPDATES, & follow my profile — click my name, above.I hope this review has saved you time and has been really helpful.

We loved the 2-3T Fruit of Loom toddlers dye free and 100% cotton boxer briefs. We have been looking for the exact ones for 4-5T but the dye free option is just not available. Finally decided to try these instead and my 3 and soon to be 4 years old approves. He loves the print and comfort of these boxer briefs and very happy with the new ones. They look much bigger when they arrived but fits perfectly after washing them.

"Shirt is smooth and cool to the touch. Has stretch to it. Is a little on the long side. Fabric gets a bit staticky as its you move so it hugs your body a bit showing all details. Shirt has a shiny look, has nice texture with lines running down. Has a ribbed collar and sleeves which also stretch well. Fabric breaths well is a little thin, so it keeps you cool even with a white T underneath. Like the look of it and goes well with a black or blue pair of jeans but goes great with Kakis or dress pants.

"Overall I am pleased with the pants, but the large said that they were a 36.5 waist, I usually wear a size 36 and they are tight. Also at 5'10 with a 30 inseam the length was just right, for a taller person they may be a bit short. They are a polyester but could pass for a linen/cotton blend. Finally, the brown color that I ordered looked tobacco brown in the picture, it is more of a peach/brown shade, not bad but just not what I was expecting.",overall i am pleased with the pants but the large said that they were a  waist i usually wear a size  and they are tight also at  with a  inseam the length was just right for a taller person they may be a bit short they are a polyester but could pass for a linencotton blend finally the brown color that i ordered looked tobacco brown in the picture it is more of a peachbrown shade not bad but just not what i was expecting,1

"I recently tried out the CRZ YOGA Men’s Linerless Workout Shorts and I must say, I’m impressed! The shorts are made of a lightweight, breathable fabric that is perfect for running and other athletic activities. The material also stretches well, allowing for a full range of motion during workouts.One of the standout features of these shorts is the zipper pocket that keeps your keys or other small items secure while you’re on the go. This is especially useful for runners who don’t want to carry a bulky bag or wallet while they exercise.Another great thing about these shorts is their durability. I’ve been wearing them for over two months now and they still look as good as new. They are definitely a great value for the price.Overall, I would highly recommend the CRZ YOGA Men’s Linerless Workout Shorts to anyone looking for a comfortable, high-quality pair of athletic shorts.

"Warning, when ordering, order one size up as these do run small. Read my whole review!!I just got this today and I must say, this is not a bad flannel coat. I say coat because it fits and wears more or less like a coat instead of a jacket.It's very comfortable to wearcas I've just been wearing it around the house to get a feel for this. I love wearing plaid/flannel shirts and coats/jacket so I'm very accustomed to wearing these.Ok so here are the pros:Very comfortable, love the color and choices of colors, materials seem very good although maybe not too rugged, good to wear out in the cold I suppose if wearing another layer of undershirt, wouldn't wear in place of a winter parka.Cons:Although I think a Large fits me good, I went ahead and just ordered an XL to see the size difference as another reviewer stated these run small. Although I do agree to a degree, the length is a bit short for my liking but isn't a deal breaker.I'm 5'7 with just a tad bit of a stomach (stuck on a temporary desk job) and I think the girth of this coat is just a tiny bit tight but again, not a deal breaker because of my poor choice of eating habit...lol. The breast pocket buttons are not very well stitched in and may fall off at some point in time as the stitching really is weak and not strong. So I suppose the longevity of these buttons will depend on the wearer.The sleeves length are spot on for what I like and am pleased with that. In the pictures I posted, you can see the inside of my hand and outside showing the length is a good fit. Also I was able to take a rear picture showing the length of this coat from behind.The very last thing I was a bit disappointed in...the color. In the listing, the pictures show a crisp sharp image. Not so when you get it. The coat literally has a little bit of a blurry look to it and not that crisp sharp look to the color like you see in the listing. Those familiar with wearing plaids and flannels know what I'm talking about.So, all in all this is not a bad coat, I just think maybe I will order a XL and compare the sizes. I like my flannels and plaids a little big because I carry concealed and those are deciding factors for me in these types of clothing. But if I were to grade this on a 5-Star grading, I'd probably give it a 4.5 just because I was disappointed with the coloring being blurred but that isn't a deal breaker.After wearing this just around the house, I think maybe this probably would fall under a jacket as I am discovering this jacket is a bit thin. But it really is comfortable to wear.Hope this helps...Update: November 13, 2023...Ok so I finally got around to ordering the XL size and I got to admit, this fits waaaay better then the size Large which I did return. Again, this is probably not the kind of jacket/coat to wear out in the freezing cold.This is more or less the kind of jacket to wear during those chilly evenings or day. I am talking maybe early winter before it gets too cold. I'm from Northern Idaho and I am familiar with the harsh winters and some winters are worse then others.If you plan on just wearing this to the store, fine go for it but bring something else too just in case. If you're in the Southern California areas, this is perfect for those winters in that area of the country.I honestly will give this a 5 star as the XL fits me much better. I'm 5'7 at about 189-193lbs with a slight stomach but average build. It's not so tight in the shoulders like the Large was and the sleeves aren't too lose, perfect for me to wear along sleeve thermal Under Armor type wicken shirt which I do wear quite often. Plan to order in other colors. I would place this right up there with Legendary Whitetail brand of these types of jacket/coats which I have quite a few of too...Pictures are of the Large size and not the XL size.Hope this helps...",warning when ordering order one size up as these do run small read my whole reviewi just got this today and i must say this is not a bad flannel coat i say coat because it fits and wears more or less like a coat instead of a jacketits very comfortable to wearcas ive just been wearing it around the house to get a feel for this i love wearing plaidflannel shirts and coatsjacket so im very accustomed to wearing theseok so here are the prosvery comfortable love the color and choices of colors materials seem very good although maybe not too rugged good to wear out in the cold i suppose if wearing another layer of undershirt wouldnt wear in place of a winter parkaconsalthough i think a large fits me good i went ahead and just ordered an xl to see the size difference as another reviewer stated these run small although i do agree to a degree the length is a bit short for my liking but isnt a deal breakerim  with just a tad bit of a stomach stuck on a temporary desk job and i think the girth of this coat is just a tiny bit tight but again not a deal breaker because of my poor choice of eating habitlol the breast pocket buttons are not very well stitched in and may fall off at some point in time as the stitching really is weak and not strong so i suppose the longevity of these buttons will depend on the wearerthe sleeves length are spot on for what i like and am pleased with that in the pictures i posted you can see the inside of my hand and outside showing the length is a good fit also i was able to take a rear picture showing the length of this coat from behindthe very last thing i was a bit disappointed inthe color in the listing the pictures show a crisp sharp image not so when you get it the coat literally has a little bit of a blurry look to it and not that crisp sharp look to the color like you see in the listing those familiar with wearing plaids and flannels know what im talking aboutso all in all this is not a bad coat i just think maybe i will order a xl and compare the sizes i like my flannels and plaids a little big because i carry concealed and those are deciding factors for me in these types of clothing but if i were to grade this on a star grading id probably give it a  just because i was disappointed with the coloring being blurred but that isnt a deal breakerafter wearing this just around the house i think maybe this probably would fall under a jacket as i am discovering this jacket is a bit thin but it really is comfortable to wearhope this helpsupdate november  ok so i finally got around to ordering the xl size and i got to admit this fits waaaay better then the size large which i did return again this is probably not the kind of jacketcoat to wear out in the freezing coldthis is more or less the kind of jacket to wear during those chilly evenings or day i am talking maybe early winter before it gets too cold im from northern idaho and i am familiar with the harsh winters and some winters are worse then othersif you plan on just wearing this to the store fine go for it but bring something else too just in case if youre in the southern california areas this is perfect for those winters in that area of the countryi honestly will give this a  star as the xl fits me much better im  at about lbs with a slight stomach but average build its not so tight in the shoulders like the large was and the sleeves arent too lose perfect for me to wear along sleeve thermal under armor type wicken shirt which i do wear quite often plan to order in other colors i would place this right up there with legendary whitetail brand of these types of jacketcoats which i have quite a few of toopictures are of the large size and not the xl sizehope this helps,1

"Overall, I am happy with my purchase. The biggest selling point for me with these shorts, is that they do not have a brief liner. I have my own athletic, supportive underwear that I use underneath of these shorts, so a liner would be unnecessary. With that in mind, if you are somebody who was looking for running shorts with built-in support, you may want to consider other options, or wear an athletic jock, or supportive pouch style underwear with these.  I think compared to other running short brands, these shorts are probably about the middle of the road quality. I purchased these on sale, so I think it was a good deal for the money. It’s got the perfect blend of synthetic fabric to be non-binding with other clothing and can even be worn as underwear. They are quick-drying , very light, and very comfortable.

"TL;DR - insanely comfortable pants well-suited to wear around the house and outdoors as long as it isn’t too cold; they are extremely thin and won’t offer much warmth but I cannot say anything negative about this purchase; worth buying a backup pair for when I wear the . . .  pants . . .off of these pants!One evening last month I put on a pair of warmup pants — THE warmup pants, I had no other — and realized they weren’t all that new when Pope JPII was alive, and the elasticity was gone completely, and there was too much pant material for my frame, and maybe I should retire these.They were fairly heavy, but I live in a sub-tropical climate and hardly ever need anything so heavy.So I bought these because they were rated well and inexpensive compared to other known brands and I was not going to be hassled by the thousands of off-brand options, all of which I regard as a gamble at best and a hassle at worstI am very pleased with my purchase. For context, I am 6’0”, between 160 and 165 lbs depending on the day, and could reasonably be described as long-legged but not drastically so.Size: I bought medium, and they fit me perfectly. Take my height and weight into account in deciding your size. They even might run a hair long, but that could be due to how they sit at my waist.Style: I wear these in and around the house, and need only impress my dog, so these were simple and basic enough that I didn't much care how they look, but the photos are accurate.Comfort: I have achieved maximum comfort permitted by natural pants law, and wear these at all times until I go out during the day, and from after I get home and dress down.Material: The material is very thin and lightweight. I don’t think I would want to be outdoors in temperatures below 60° F for long in these, but that’s not of much concern to me.

"Very comfortable, medium-weight, and surprisingly breathable. I wear them around the house, in the yard, and for working out.Kind of the optimal design: cool enough for hot weather, heavy enough to not be revealing, long enough that they don't look like running shorts, short enough they don't look like basketball shorts. Not clingy-tight but not a lot excess fabric either on an average-athletic build.They're much more breathable than I would expect for fabric this weight. Unlike some synthetics, the fabric doesn't seem to pick up / hold sweat smells.The mesh-lined pockets are deep enough to hold a large phone or normal men's wallet, but heavier items will swing around if you're moving-- the pockets aren't structured since these are gym shorts.True to size-- not tight-clingy like a lot of UA gear can be.I picked up a pair of these because of the price, not expecting much, but I wear them so much that I've ordered a 2nd pair. I have some Vuoris I like better, but those are literally 5x the price.

"I'm 5'5 and 115 lbs and the small fits with plenty of room. It's very loose and flowy, which is the style so I don't mind it being slightly oversized. The material is nice - soft and thin without being too thin. Great for summer, I've been wearing it a lot and have gotten compliments. The only thing I don't like is the stitching is pretty low quality. Instead of correctly finishing a line of stitching, the stitching just goes right off the edge of the fabric, leaving threads everywhere. I had to trim the threads off every single seam (see pic - all seams were just like that) and I think it's a matter of time before the stitching starts pulling out since it isn't sewn off correctly at the ends.",im  and  lbs and the small fits with plenty of room its very loose and flowy which is the style so i dont mind it being slightly oversized the material is nice  soft and thin without being too thin great for summer ive been wearing it a lot and have gotten compliments the only thing i dont like is the stitching is pretty low quality instead of correctly finishing a line of stitching the stitching just goes right off the edge of the fabric leaving threads everywhere i had to trim the threads off every single seam see pic  all seams were just like that and i think its a matter of time before the stitching starts pulling out since it isnt sewn off correctly at the ends,1

"I recently bought second time the Ralph Lauren Polo Cotton Socks (I want more)) and I gotta say, I'm really happy with them. Here's my take:These socks are super soft and fit just right. They're made from good-quality cotton that feels nice on the skin and doesn’t irritate. The elastic band is perfect too, holding the socks up without being too tight or leaving marks.Ralph Lauren is known for its classic and stylish designs, and these socks don’t disappoint. The little Polo logo is a nice touch, not too flashy. They come in different colors, so you can wear them with anything, whether it’s casual or a bit more dressed up.I've washed them a few times now, and they still look and feel great. No pilling or any signs of wear so far, which is impressive. They seem like they'll last a good while.Even though they might be a bit more expensive than other socks, the quality makes it worth it. They’re comfy and last long, so it’s a good deal in my book.I really recommend the Ralph Lauren Polo Cotton Socks. They’re stylish, comfy, and durable, making them a great buy.

"I‚Äôm an 18 year old girl who was looking for simple white shoes that wasn‚Äôt basic air forces that can easily slip on and slip off and am able to comfortably walk around/go about for an entire day (take the bus and get to school and walk around campus for example) without any problems. These shoes were pretty trendy on Pinterest so I bought them. But I had to buy this pair 3 different times before getting the right fit which was quite frustrating! I am normally a perfect size 6, but when it came it was SO abnormally tight, it felt exactly like a size 5 because I have a size 5 pair of shoes. So I ordered a 6.5 instead. Still very tight, practically no difference. I was irritated at this point, why did these run SO small? So finally I bought another pair size 7 and they fit me perfectly and comfortably, not too big or small. They were also 50% off so I‚Äôm really grateful for that. I wore them out later today and they were very comfortable, the inside is nice material as well and I rly like the look and color. I can slip these on and off with ease! I‚Äôm sure these will be perfect for every day wear when school starts. I would recommend sizing up with these, I don‚Äôt have particularly wide or long feet so idk why I seem to one of the only ppl with this sizing issue. I know I‚Äôm not typically a size 7 because my size 7 shoes are too big and not wearable as a result. But other than that I‚Äôm very happy with these and for the 50% price it can‚Äôt be beat",i‚äôm an  year old girl who was looking for simple white shoes that wasn‚äôt basic air forces that can easily slip on and slip off and am able to comfortably walk aroundgo about for an entire day take the bus and get to school and walk around campus for example without any problems these shoes were pretty trendy on pinterest so i bought them but i had to buy this pair  different times before getting the right fit which was quite frustrating i am normally a perfect size  but when it came it was so abnormally tight it felt exactly like a size  because i have a size  pair of shoes so i ordered a  instead still very tight practically no difference i was irritated at this point why did these run so small so finally i bought another pair size  and they fit me perfectly and comfortably not too big or small they were also  off so i‚äôm really grateful for that i wore them out later today and they were very comfortable the inside is nice material as well and i rly like the look and color i can slip these on and off with ease i‚äôm sure these will be perfect for every day wear when school starts i would recommend sizing up with these i don‚äôt have particularly wide or long feet so idk why i seem to one of the only ppl with this sizing issue i know i‚äôm not typically a size  because my size  shoes are too big and not wearable as a result but other than that i‚äôm very happy with these and for the  price it can‚äôt be beat,1

"I finally found jeans that fit me and make me look good! I'm 5'8 and 200lbs. These are size 16, 32. I was so excited when I put these on and they not only fit perfectly, but I look good in them too! It's been awhile since I found jeans like that. These are great on my legs; they are nice and slimming with a perfect flare at the bottom around my ankles and feet (for boots which I don't wear, but heels would work well) and around the waist they are super comfortable and flexible (stretchy) but tight enough to hold my belly in. Most jeans pinch me around the middle, but this is the first pair that I've found that are not too lose nor too tight around my belly. I don't need to wear a belt. I bought another pair and will probably get a third. They look good enough that I can wear them to work and still look casually professional as well.

"I recently purchased the Clarks Men's Oxford shoes, and I must say, I am thoroughly impressed. These shoes effortlessly blend classic elegance with unmatched comfort, making them a perfect addition to any wardrobe.The first thing that caught my attention was the timeless design. The Oxfords feature a sleek silhouette and high-quality leather craftsmanship that exude sophistication. Whether paired with formal attire or dressed down for a more casual look, these shoes consistently elevate my style.Beyond their aesthetics, the comfort level is exceptional. The cushioned insole provides excellent support throughout the day, making them ideal for long hours on my feet. Additionally, the outsole offers a confident grip, ensuring stability on various surfaces.I also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction. It's evident that Clarks prioritizes durability, and I believe these shoes will stand the test of time.One minor aspect worth mentioning is the initial break-in period. Like most high-quality leather shoes, they required a few wears to conform to my feet perfectly. However, once they molded, the fit became incredibly comfortable.In conclusion, the Clarks Men's Oxford shoes offer a winning combination of style, comfort, and durability. Whether for formal events or daily wear, they consistently deliver a polished and refined look. I highly recommend these Oxfords to anyone seeking a timeless and reliable footwear option.",i recently purchased the clarks mens oxford shoes and i must say i am thoroughly impressed these shoes effortlessly blend classic elegance with unmatched comfort making them a perfect addition to any wardrobethe first thing that caught my attention was the timeless design the oxfords feature a sleek silhouette and highquality leather craftsmanship that exude sophistication whether paired with formal attire or dressed down for a more casual look these shoes consistently elevate my stylebeyond their aesthetics the comfort level is exceptional the cushioned insole provides excellent support throughout the day making them ideal for long hours on my feet additionally the outsole offers a confident grip ensuring stability on various surfacesi also appreciate the attention to detail in the stitching and overall construction its evident that clarks prioritizes durability and i believe these shoes will stand the test of timeone minor aspect worth mentioning is the initial breakin period like most highquality leather shoes they required a few wears to conform to my feet perfectly however once they molded the fit became incredibly comfortablein conclusion the clarks mens oxford shoes offer a winning combination of style comfort and durability whether for formal events or daily wear they consistently deliver a polished and refined look i highly recommend these oxfords to anyone seeking a timeless and reliable footwear option,1

"I’ve been on the lookout for a pair of **comfortable, durable cargo pants** that I can wear both on casual days and for more active pursuits, and the **Wrangler Authentics Men's Relaxed Fit Stretch Cargo Pant** has definitely exceeded my expectations.First, the **fit**—these pants are labeled as **relaxed fit**, and I can tell right away that they’re designed to give you plenty of **room to move** without feeling baggy or oversized. The **stretch fabric** is a standout feature, allowing for easy movement, whether you’re out running errands, hiking, or just lounging around. It’s the kind of flexibility you want in a pant that can handle a bit of everything, and these cargo pants deliver just that.The material feels sturdy but **soft to the touch**, which means I don’t feel stiff or restricted even after wearing them for hours. I also appreciate the **reinforced stitching**, which makes them look and feel like a pant that can last through rough and everyday wear. Whether I’m working in the yard, on a weekend trip, or just out with friends, these cargo pants hold up well to all kinds of activities without showing signs of wear or tear.Speaking of durability, the **pockets** on these pants are excellent. There are **two front pockets**, **two back pockets**, and **two large cargo pockets** on the thighs—plenty of room to store tools, keys, phone, or anything else you need on hand. I love that the cargo pockets are big enough to hold items securely without feeling bulky or getting in the way. The added bonus is the **flap closures** on the cargo pockets, which keep everything in place.In terms of **style**, these pants have a clean, **casual look** that pairs easily with just about anything. I can dress them up with a button-up shirt for a laid-back look or wear them with a t-shirt for a more relaxed vibe. The **classic colors** (I opted for the khaki shade) are versatile and can easily be mixed and matched with my existing wardrobe.I also want to mention the **elastic waistband**—it adds a bit of extra comfort and allows for a better, more flexible fit around the waist, so I’m not constantly adjusting throughout the day.Overall, the **Wrangler Authentics Men's Relaxed Fit Stretch Cargo Pant** is a fantastic blend of comfort, durability, and style. If you’re looking for a pair of cargo pants that can keep up with your active lifestyle while still offering a relaxed, casual fit, these are definitely worth checking out.",i’ve been on the lookout for a pair of comfortable durable cargo pants that i can wear both on casual days and for more active pursuits and the wrangler authentics mens relaxed fit stretch cargo pant has definitely exceeded my expectationsfirst the fit—these pants are labeled as relaxed fit and i can tell right away that they’re designed to give you plenty of room to move without feeling baggy or oversized the stretch fabric is a standout feature allowing for easy movement whether you’re out running errands hiking or just lounging around it’s the kind of flexibility you want in a pant that can handle a bit of everything and these cargo pants deliver just thatthe material feels sturdy but soft to the touch which means i don’t feel stiff or restricted even after wearing them for hours i also appreciate the reinforced stitching which makes them look and feel like a pant that can last through rough and everyday wear whether i’m working in the yard on a weekend trip or just out with friends these cargo pants hold up well to all kinds of activities without showing signs of wear or tearspeaking of durability the pockets on these pants are excellent there are two front pockets two back pockets and two large cargo pockets on the thighs—plenty of room to store tools keys phone or anything else you need on hand i love that the cargo pockets are big enough to hold items securely without feeling bulky or getting in the way the added bonus is the flap closures on the cargo pockets which keep everything in placein terms of style these pants have a clean casual look that pairs easily with just about anything i can dress them up with a buttonup shirt for a laidback look or wear them with a tshirt for a more relaxed vibe the classic colors i opted for the khaki shade are versatile and can easily be mixed and matched with my existing wardrobei also want to mention the elastic waistband—it adds a bit of extra comfort and allows for a better more flexible fit around the waist so i’m not constantly adjusting throughout the dayoverall the wrangler authentics mens relaxed fit stretch cargo pant is a fantastic blend of comfort durability and style if you’re looking for a pair of cargo pants that can keep up with your active lifestyle while still offering a relaxed casual fit these are definitely worth checking out,1

"This is a very pretty top for summer. The polyester/rayon/spandex material is soft and lightweight and feels really good against the skin. The modest split v neckline shows of a pretty necklace without exposing any cleavage. The 3/4 sleeves can be rolled up and secured with a buttoned tab. The buttons near the hem add an interesting detail. This shirt is long enough to wear with leggings or can be worn with jeans or a nice skirt. It's beautifully made, and washes wonderfully with no shrinkage or loss of color. I ordered my usual size (L) and I am very happy with the fit.

"I recently snagged the COOFANDY Men’s 2 Pack Gym Workout Shorts, and let me tell you, they’re like a personal trainer for your legs—minus the shouting and the protein shakes. These shorts are so comfy and stylish, I’m half convinced they have superpowers.First off, the quick-dry feature is a game changer. I’ve sweat through more gym sessions than I care to admit, and these shorts somehow manage to dry faster than my ego after a failed attempt at a pull-up. It's like magic—sweat disappears before it even has a chance to settle in.The 7-inch length is the perfect compromise between I’m not here to show off my quads and I still want to look like I know what I’m doing. It’s also long enough to hide my inevitable post-workout leg jiggle but short enough to keep my cool factor high. I’m pretty sure these shorts could make even the most uncoordinated person look like a professional athlete.And let’s not forget the design. I’ve never been complimented on my gym attire until I started wearing these. I’ve had more “Nice shorts!” comments than I ever thought possible. It’s like these shorts have a built-in charm offensive.The only downside? Now I’m convinced I need to go to the gym more often just to justify owning these shorts. I might need an intervention because I’ve started showing up at the gym in full gear, even when I’m just there for the smoothie bar.In summary, if you want to look good while pretending you’re lifting heavy things, the COOFANDY Men’s Gym Workout Shorts are your ticket to gym fashion greatness. They’re comfortable, stylish, and they dry faster than you can say personal best.",i recently snagged the coofandy men’s  pack gym workout shorts and let me tell you they’re like a personal trainer for your legs—minus the shouting and the protein shakes these shorts are so comfy and stylish i’m half convinced they have superpowersfirst off the quickdry feature is a game changer i’ve sweat through more gym sessions than i care to admit and these shorts somehow manage to dry faster than my ego after a failed attempt at a pullup its like magic—sweat disappears before it even has a chance to settle inthe inch length is the perfect compromise between i’m not here to show off my quads and i still want to look like i know what i’m doing it’s also long enough to hide my inevitable postworkout leg jiggle but short enough to keep my cool factor high i’m pretty sure these shorts could make even the most uncoordinated person look like a professional athleteand let’s not forget the design i’ve never been complimented on my gym attire until i started wearing these i’ve had more “nice shorts” comments than i ever thought possible it’s like these shorts have a builtin charm offensivethe only downside now i’m convinced i need to go to the gym more often just to justify owning these shorts i might need an intervention because i’ve started showing up at the gym in full gear even when i’m just there for the smoothie barin summary if you want to look good while pretending you’re lifting heavy things the coofandy men’s gym workout shorts are your ticket to gym fashion greatness they’re comfortable stylish and they dry faster than you can say personal best,1

"My biggest concern about these pants (or ANY of the dozens of linen pants choices here on Amazon) was the length.  Having them all sized as S, M, L, XL, XXL instead of with an actual inseam measurement was a little too vague for a tall guy like me.  I'm 6'3, 190 lbs. and usually wear 34 x 34 pants.  Based on another review, I took a chance on these XXL and they're perfect.  The color - khaki - is just what I wanted, and the material seems like good quality.  The elastic waistband fits comfortably snug on my 34/35-inch waist, but the drawstring helps if you want a tighter fit.  And it even has belt loops if you want a belted look.  I also like that they have back pockets that button if I'm carrying a wallet.  They're obviously quite a bit baggier than I would normally wear, but that's what I was going for with these: casual, lightweight, comfy for a beach wedding vow renewal.  They just arrived, so I've only tried them on for size.

"I just wanted some comfy, canvas sneakers for everyday wear. I started by ordering only one pair to make sure they would fit before buying any more. They are sized a bit large but I knew that from reading the reviews and because my foot measurement coincided with their size 9 on the size chart. I normally wear a size 10 so I (gladly) went down to a size 9. They fit perfectly. The shoes are lightweight and comfortable. They also have plenty of cushioning. I think there's enough room in the shoe to add an insert for arch support if you need that - I don't because I don't have much of an arch anyway. The laces are not the stretchy type. They are the standard cotton-type, which I like.I was so happy with my first pair (the multi-color red/pink), that I bought 2 more - the Volcanic Gray Lava Linen and the Olive Green. I'm so tempted to also get the solid pink and the navy blue but that will have to wait.Pros: Very attractive, pretty saturated colors, nice detail stitching, comfortableCons: No arch support - not a problem for me, but could be an issue if you have high arches, sizing is a little big - but again, not a problem for me",i just wanted some comfy canvas sneakers for everyday wear i started by ordering only one pair to make sure they would fit before buying any more they are sized a bit large but i knew that from reading the reviews and because my foot measurement coincided with their size  on the size chart i normally wear a size  so i gladly went down to a size  they fit perfectly the shoes are lightweight and comfortable they also have plenty of cushioning i think theres enough room in the shoe to add an insert for arch support if you need that  i dont because i dont have much of an arch anyway the laces are not the stretchy type they are the standard cottontype which i likei was so happy with my first pair the multicolor redpink that i bought  more  the volcanic gray lava linen and the olive green im so tempted to also get the solid pink and the navy blue but that will have to waitpros very attractive pretty saturated colors nice detail stitching comfortablecons no arch support  not a problem for me but could be an issue if you have high arches sizing is a little big  but again not a problem for me,1

"UPDATE: initially I gave these pants a five, but have since backed it down to a four. It’s been a few months, the pants have started doing some pilling in the upper inside of the thighs and crotch area. I really don’t feel like I have worn them enough to do this. I think the company should make and sell another pair without the string around the waist to allow the wearer to look a little more dressy. By the way, the color has stayed a bright white.I am a woman that wears 12-14 in pants. I bought these because I have to be covered in the summer. These pants fit great. Thigh has room, not tight in the crotch. I am 5’6”” I like to wear pants with 30-32”inseam. These fit like a 31” inseam in the medium size. Look much better on than the gauzy pants I have bought  before. Made from 31% Linen, 21% cotton, and 47% viscose. Breathable. Bright white. I wish the material was a little softer.  They  are a little stiffer so they look a more dressy and  hold a crease. The draw string makes it look a little more casual. I have tucked them in the pants when I needed more dressy.  It says to hand wash. I washed in washing machine and had no trouble.  I would highly recommend for me and women.  Perfect for string and summer. Perfect for casual and dressy.

"So good!Comfort:The first thing I noticed was how soft and breathable the fabric is. Made from a blend of cotton and spandex, they have just the right amount of stretch while remaining incredibly comfortable throughout the day. There’s no pinching or bunching, even during more active moments, and they feel almost weightless.Fit:The fit is spot-on. They’re snug without feeling tight, and they maintain their shape without sagging or riding up. The waistband is smooth and doesn’t dig into your skin, which is a huge plus for all-day wear. I’ve worn them to the gym, during long workdays, and they’ve held up perfectly.Design:[Brand] has done a great job balancing style with functionality. The simple, sleek design makes them easy to wear under any outfit, and the subtle branding on the waistband isn’t overly flashy. They come in a variety of colors and patterns, so there’s something for every preference.Durability:After several washes, these have shown no signs of wear or fading. The fabric has maintained its softness, and there’s no fraying at the seams. These definitely feel like they’re built to last, unlike some cheaper pairs that lose their elasticity after a few washes.Value for Money:They’re a bit pricier than some basic brands, but in my opinion, the comfort and durability are worth the extra cost. When you wear something all day, it’s worth investing in quality, and [Brand] delivers on that front.Overall:These are probably some of the best underwear I’ve owned in terms of comfort, fit, and durability. Whether you’re lounging around or on the move, they hold up great in any situation.

"I've been wearing Brooks Adrenaline GTS shoes for 8 years, and during that time have bought multiple pairs of 3 different models of GTS shoes.  They are really good shoes, very comfortable, I can very easily wear then all day long (more comfortable than just wearing socks around the house), and perfect for the particular pronation of my feet.  However, this is the first time I've purchased the 2024 edition of these shoes (the Adrenaline GTS 24), and I'm disappointed to discover that there is now a conspicuous advertising message on the tongue of the shoes.  In a bold black stripe, it says Adrenaline 24 GTS, which is eye-catching and detracts from the appearance of the shoes.  On the GTS 18 and GTS 16 models of these shoes, the branding on the tongue of the shoe was very subtle, which I like.  But with these GTS 24 shoes, it's kind of like wearing a big NIKE message on the front of my shirt or something.  Part of the reason I chose this un-flashy gray color is so my shoes will blend in with any casual outfit I wear, but with these shoes, I feel like I'm making a big statement to the world that I love my Brooks Adrenaline GTS shoes.  The bold black stripe is made of a spandex material, and is only sewn-in on the ends of the stripe, so I guess I could use some scissors to cut it off.  But then there would be this little messy black edge where I cut off the advertising.  Anyway, bummer about the bold black advertising stripe, and I hope they omit this in future models of this shoe.

"I bought three of these in black, navy, and white. They're my go-to for working out or when I'm at home.Here's why I say to avoid the white ones. When I received it, they were more of a silver-white color than I expected but I didn't mind. The real magic began when I went to wash it. Machine washed with like colors, tumble-dried low, and Viola! Green shorts! Kind of like an old mirror green. Best to stick with darker colors I assume.Otherwise, they're great! Nice elastic waist, thin material (but not underwear-thin) with a solid layer underneath. Sturdy enough to toss in the wash without much thought.Haven't had any trouble getting anything snagged in the mesh on the outer layer, feels like you'd have to really brush up on something to do that. Pockets are deep enough to keep my phone comfortably while moving around.I'd say the only downside is length, I'm 6ft and this stops just above my knee.Overall, I'm pretty happy with them.

"I am going to return my top as I think it may be a little big and the print is beautiful but a bit busy for me.  Makes me feel matronly for some reason.  The top is well made, lightweight and comfortable.  I may reorder in a solid, debating on the size.  I fluctuate between a large and extra large.  Because it has no stretch in the bust I think sizing down to a large might be too tight for a busty woman,  but the shoulders and volume of the top seem a little too much in the xl.  Not sure.  I  did like this top and would recommend it.  For me personally, I would choose a small print, rather than a large one, if you carry your weight in the upper torso.  Makes you look bigger.",i am going to return my top as i think it may be a little big and the print is beautiful but a bit busy for me  makes me feel matronly for some reason  the top is well made lightweight and comfortable  i may reorder in a solid debating on the size  i fluctuate between a large and extra large  because it has no stretch in the bust i think sizing down to a large might be too tight for a busty woman  but the shoulders and volume of the top seem a little too much in the xl  not sure  i  did like this top and would recommend it  for me personally i would choose a small print rather than a large one if you carry your weight in the upper torso  makes you look bigger,1

"These were too cute to pass up, and we needed more onesies with long sleeves since we keep it cold in our house and our baby hates the cold! She's approx. 22 long with a short torso and ~12lbs and the 3-6mo size fits her with a little room to grow without being baggy or too loose.There are only three snaps around the diaper area, and plenty of stretchy fabric to go around and through the legs over the diaper.

"I wanted to post an initial review in case anyone like me has events this weekend and is considering buying this.TL; Dr: these shaper shorts are great if you're looking for light compression/support and some smoothing.As a tall plus size woman (5'11, 310lbs, 50-46-56, usually wear a 3x/4x), this item suits my needs to look a bit smoother under clingy dresses, prevent thigh chafing, and provide some abdominal compression for POTS symptoms relief. I have my highschool reunion this weekend and will be wearing a bodycon dress, so I wanted some shaper shorts that would smooth me out a bit without being uncomfortable. The mixed reviews on this item scared me a bit, but so far I'm glad I took a chance. I've been wearing them to work the past couple of days to test them out in case I needed to switch sizes or to another brand.These shaper shorts are surprisingly comfortable for having a decent amount of light-modedate compression. While I'm tall, I'm also quite short-waisted with a long hip/pelvis, and carry most of my weight in my stomach, butt, and upper thighs. The waistband comes all the way up to my bra line, but so far has not rolled down thanks to the fabric quality and small stays strategically placed. The legs are also a great length to not roll on my thick thighs - I'm easily able to adjust them higher or lower depending on the length of my skirt. The fabric is fairly breathable and soft, doesn't irritate my sensitive skin. Other than the very top of the waistband, I can't feel them on after a bit.I'm glad I went with the 4x instead of the 3x. My measurements were on the low end of the 4x, and I decided to opt for comfort over stronger compression. The shorts are quite stretchy, and I imagine someone several inches bigger than me could comfortably wear them. The shorts washed fine in a laundry bag on delicate cycle and didn't shrink too much. I can't speak to their long-term durability and performance, but I will update this review after my events with pictures and final thoughts.Overall, I definitely can recommend these to others looking for similar qualities in shaper shorts. I hope this review helps other tall plus size women as I know how hard it is to find comfortable, flattering clothing for us.",i wanted to post an initial review in case anyone like me has events this weekend and is considering buying thistl dr these shaper shorts are great if youre looking for light compressionsupport and some smoothingas a tall plus size woman  lbs  usually wear a xx this item suits my needs to look a bit smoother under clingy dresses prevent thigh chafing and provide some abdominal compression for pots symptoms relief i have my highschool reunion this weekend and will be wearing a bodycon dress so i wanted some shaper shorts that would smooth me out a bit without being uncomfortable the mixed reviews on this item scared me a bit but so far im glad i took a chance ive been wearing them to work the past couple of days to test them out in case i needed to switch sizes or to another brandthese shaper shorts are surprisingly comfortable for having a decent amount of lightmodedate compression while im tall im also quite shortwaisted with a long hippelvis and carry most of my weight in my stomach butt and upper thighs the waistband comes all the way up to my bra line but so far has not rolled down thanks to the fabric quality and small stays strategically placed the legs are also a great length to not roll on my thick thighs  im easily able to adjust them higher or lower depending on the length of my skirt the fabric is fairly breathable and soft doesnt irritate my sensitive skin other than the very top of the waistband i cant feel them on after a bitim glad i went with the x instead of the x my measurements were on the low end of the x and i decided to opt for comfort over stronger compression the shorts are quite stretchy and i imagine someone several inches bigger than me could comfortably wear them the shorts washed fine in a laundry bag on delicate cycle and didnt shrink too much i cant speak to their longterm durability and performance but i will update this review after my events with pictures and final thoughtsoverall i definitely can recommend these to others looking for similar qualities in shaper shorts i hope this review helps other tall plus size women as i know how hard it is to find comfortable flattering clothing for us,1

"I'm usually an 100% cotton guy and search Amazon high and low for shirts and other things that fit this preference.  I was looking for some good basic t-shirts for round the house ware or maybe under a nicer shirt... but NOT undershirts.  These were very well reviewed, but they are a cotton-poly blend and thus I was suspicious.  I bought one as a tester.  It was nice and soft and well-shaped right out of the package.  Not too trim, not to wide.  Good fabric weight and density.  I'm 5'-10, 185 lbs. and the Large fits me well.  I wore and washed it three times to see how it held up and it was perfect.  No shrinkage to note, no puckering or warping of the collar or seams.  Still nicely soft and good looking, so, I bought three more in various colors.

"Let me preface this by saying I'm not one for writing reviews, but for these TELALEO Compression Shorts, I'll make an exception. If you're recovering from hernia surgery, listen up - these shorts are game-changers.Pre-Surgery Skeptic:Before my surgery, I was skeptical about compression shorts. They looked...intense. Would they be comfortable? Restrictive? Honestly, I just wanted to be pain-free, not squeezed into sausage casing. But my doctor insisted, so I ordered a pack of TELALEOs on a whim.Post-Surgery Superhero:From the moment I slipped them on, it was like a sigh of relief for my entire core. The gentle compression was supportive but not suffocating, holding everything in place without feeling constricting. Walking, even just around the house, felt easier and less painful.Here's why I'm a die-hard TELALEO fan:Comfort is king: The soft, breathable fabric feels like a second skin. No chafing, no bunching, just pure comfort that lasts all day (and sometimes into the night, I confess).Compression that cares: The targeted support cradles your core without feeling overwhelming. It's like a gentle hug that reduces swelling and keeps everything feeling secure.Mobility matters: I was worried compression would limit my movement, but these shorts actually improve it. They feel like a stable base, allowing me to move with more confidence and less pain.Bonus benefits: The flat seams and tagless design eliminate any potential irritation, and the convenient pockets are perfect for stashing your phone or keys.More than just shorts, these are recovery allies:These TELALEO shorts have become an essential part of my post-surgery journey. They've helped me manage pain, regain confidence, and even get back to some light exercise sooner than I expected. They're not magic, but they're pretty darn close.Final verdict:If you're facing hernia surgery, do yourself a favor and grab a pack of these TELALEO Compression Shorts. They're an investment in your comfort, recovery, and well-being. Trust me, your sore abs will thank you.P.S. I even bought an extra pack for everyday wear.

"Grandsons love the, fit, feel and style. I love being the awesome Grandma! No shrinkage that we have noticed so far, and true sizing. Never have to worry about the torso length either. My grandchildren (my children were the same way) are tall and thin, so torso length and shrinkage is always a concern. And the brand is a matter of pride with children after a certain age. I  don't mind if the product lasts, resists fading, resists stains, doesn't shrink up with each wash, and can be washed simply without special treatment. I have 3 grandchildren and the boys are barely a year apart. My daughter has enough on her plate with extracurricular activities, sports, children who enjoy camping and an active lifestyle without clothing that requires special steps and delicate treatment.

"This was an amazing birthday gift from my sister. At the time I almost gave up on trying to find shirts that fit me well because my height is essentially 5 ft 11, and my current weight is 165, with a slim build. What made this shirt perfect for me is the classic fitted design, coupled with the material, which stretches smoothly.When you open the packaging, the fist thing that hits you is how bold the colors are. The shirt looks wrinkled when you remove it from its packaging, but all you’ll need to do is iron it for it to essentially become wrinkle free. You can’t iron it directly because the material will get damaged, so you’ll need to take a cotton pillow case, or a cotton shirt, and put it over the shirt to get the wrinkles out. Once that’s done, what you’re left with is a shirt that has stronger material around the collar, which makes it stay in place, as well as a shirt that’s largely stain resistant, which makes it easy to spot clean with simple soap and water. As a DJ that does venues, weddings, and private parties, this makes the shirt perfect for me. I love these shirts so much that it lead to buying the blue, rose red, and white shirts, since my sister sent me the solid black shirt as a gift. My plan is to get nearly all of them since they look color accurate. There have been a lot of complements on how nice these shirts look, or how well they fit. Normally, I wear them with a solid black undershirt, and the colors are so bold and strong that you can’t see the undershirt. Lion Nardo’s white dress shirt is only color they have that’s very slightly see through, so my recommendation is wearing a light grey or white undershirt to make it pop more. All in all, the only complaint that someone might have is that the material feels different than any other dress shirt if you wear it without an undershirt.I currently have 6 different colors of these Lion Nardo shirts, and as noted, my plan to get more of them in different colors. It’s safe for me to say that these stylishly fitted, well designed, bold and wrinkle free shirts make them an easy 5 star product.",this was an amazing birthday gift from my sister at the time i almost gave up on trying to find shirts that fit me well because my height is essentially  ft  and my current weight is  with a slim build what made this shirt perfect for me is the classic fitted design coupled with the material which stretches smoothlywhen you open the packaging the fist thing that hits you is how bold the colors are the shirt looks wrinkled when you remove it from its packaging but all you’ll need to do is iron it for it to essentially become wrinkle free you can’t iron it directly because the material will get damaged so you’ll need to take a cotton pillow case or a cotton shirt and put it over the shirt to get the wrinkles out once that’s done what you’re left with is a shirt that has stronger material around the collar which makes it stay in place as well as a shirt that’s largely stain resistant which makes it easy to spot clean with simple soap and water as a dj that does venues weddings and private parties this makes the shirt perfect for me i love these shirts so much that it lead to buying the blue rose red and white shirts since my sister sent me the solid black shirt as a gift my plan is to get nearly all of them since they look color accurate there have been a lot of complements on how nice these shirts look or how well they fit normally i wear them with a solid black undershirt and the colors are so bold and strong that you can’t see the undershirt lion nardo’s white dress shirt is only color they have that’s very slightly see through so my recommendation is wearing a light grey or white undershirt to make it pop more all in all the only complaint that someone might have is that the material feels different than any other dress shirt if you wear it without an undershirti currently have  different colors of these lion nardo shirts and as noted my plan to get more of them in different colors it’s safe for me to say that these stylishly fitted well designed bold and wrinkle free shirts make them an easy  star product,1

These jeans offer the perfect combination of comfort, durability, and stylish design, making them a must-have for anyone looking for high-quality denim at an affordable price.Fit & Comfort ‚Äì 5/5One of the standout features of these jeans is how incredibly comfortable they are.

"This might not be brief, but it will be efficient (and worth it)!1. I bought/tried these shoes because, within six months, I have always ripped the front of my new balance shoes (for ~ a decade) requiring new ones. Hence I waited 1 year + to write this review...2. These shoes are as comfortable as new balance and still look new! So no need to constantly replace them... Or baby them (I'm hard on shoes).As you can imagine the steel keeps the front of the shoe from ripping. So never again...3. I run (with my dog -- fast) in these shoes, they are that comfortable.4. Therefore they are perfect from a security perspective. Not only can no one stomp on your foot and do you harm, but imagine getting kicked with these suckers on! Also, you could run away if you needed to...5. These shoes are so comfortable, I routinely think I'm wearing my slippers and thus fail to swap them when I get home. I've caught myself many times realizing I wore them all day.6. I made a mistake when I bought my first pair. I knew I would get lazy and not change shoes to walk my dog, so I wanted to avoid smashing my toes against the steel plate during a run. If you're a runner of any distance, you know how much damage that can do to your feet. So I bought 10s instead of 9.5. Four months later I bought 9.5 because they clearly accounted for that in the design. And the 10s were too big. My feet were sliding around too much in those, even with pads in them.7. They are roomy vertically so I doubled up some pads in them (the 9.5s) thus increasing their comfort. Yet they remain roomy/comfortable. I never bump up against the plate.8. You can put HEAVY things on them, I often hang drywall, and you can set it on your shoes feeling no pressure on your feet while keeping the drywall off the ground.9. They are a tad on the warm side. Terrific in winter, and even good for walking in snow, but in the summer, on a hot day my feet will sweat. Not wonderful. They breathe, but there are tradeoffs. IE It's hard to breathe through a steel plate. So I can't blame the manufacturer, I still love them.10. The sole is not particularly flexible, it doesn't exactly conform/bend to your feet during a run, but I wouldn't think buyers of shoes like these would care.  I got used to it, but it's worth mentioning in case others might (care). And that leads to my next point:11. During a run, a sharp rock came up through the bottom of my first pair. I was shocked because that never happened before. And I suspect the ridgidness of the sole may have contributed. They weren't destroyed by that, but if you're walking around a construction site, be careful. Safe on top, not so sure about the bottom. In a year + that hasn't happened with this pair. They're not bad soles, but perhaps the only room for improvement.12. I never thought someone stomping on my foot could do me harm. I thought that was ridiculous in movies until I dropped something heavy on my foot 2 years ago. Wow - ouch! So even if you don't do construction, these are a great upgrade to your personal security for that reason alone.13. Even with the steel plate and sturdy construction, I don't find them all that heavy (anymore), but they are heavier and a bit clunky, runners will notice and it took some getting used to. Eventually my laziness, about changing shoes, won out and now I'm used to running in them. And I no longer view them as such a drag. For several months, I loathed running in them until one day I just forgot.14. I don't consider them waterproof. Water resistant maybe, but don't sell your waders. Your feet will get wet if you submerge them.15. If you want shoes that will last forever, look good without maintenance, increase your personal security, protect your feet, and that you will eventually find very comfortable, these are for you.",this might not be brief but it will be efficient and worth it i boughttried these shoes because within six months i have always ripped the front of my new balance shoes for  a decade requiring new ones hence i waited  year  to write this review these shoes are as comfortable as new balance and still look new so no need to constantly replace them or baby them im hard on shoesas you can imagine the steel keeps the front of the shoe from ripping so never again i run with my dog  fast in these shoes they are that comfortable therefore they are perfect from a security perspective not only can no one stomp on your foot and do you harm but imagine getting kicked with these suckers on also you could run away if you needed to these shoes are so comfortable i routinely think im wearing my slippers and thus fail to swap them when i get home ive caught myself many times realizing i wore them all day i made a mistake when i bought my first pair i knew i would get lazy and not change shoes to walk my dog so i wanted to avoid smashing my toes against the steel plate during a run if youre a runner of any distance you know how much damage that can do to your feet so i bought s instead of  four months later i bought  because they clearly accounted for that in the design and the s were too big my feet were sliding around too much in those even with pads in them they are roomy vertically so i doubled up some pads in them the s thus increasing their comfort yet they remain roomycomfortable i never bump up against the plate you can put heavy things on them i often hang drywall and you can set it on your shoes feeling no pressure on your feet while keeping the drywall off the ground they are a tad on the warm side terrific in winter and even good for walking in snow but in the summer on a hot day my feet will sweat not wonderful they breathe but there are tradeoffs ie its hard to breathe through a steel plate so i cant blame the manufacturer i still love them the sole is not particularly flexible it doesnt exactly conformbend to your feet during a run but i wouldnt think buyers of shoes like these would care  i got used to it but its worth mentioning in case others might care and that leads to my next point during a run a sharp rock came up through the bottom of my first pair i was shocked because that never happened before and i suspect the ridgidness of the sole may have contributed they werent destroyed by that but if youre walking around a construction site be careful safe on top not so sure about the bottom in a year  that hasnt happened with this pair theyre not bad soles but perhaps the only room for improvement i never thought someone stomping on my foot could do me harm i thought that was ridiculous in movies until i dropped something heavy on my foot  years ago wow  ouch so even if you dont do construction these are a great upgrade to your personal security for that reason alone even with the steel plate and sturdy construction i dont find them all that heavy anymore but they are heavier and a bit clunky runners will notice and it took some getting used to eventually my laziness about changing shoes won out and now im used to running in them and i no longer view them as such a drag for several months i loathed running in them until one day i just forgot i dont consider them waterproof water resistant maybe but dont sell your waders your feet will get wet if you submerge them if you want shoes that will last forever look good without maintenance increase your personal security protect your feet and that you will eventually find very comfortable these are for you,1

"I was getting ready to take a trip to England, Scotland, and Ireland, and needed a jacket that would handle temps between upper 40's and lower 60's (October and November) with occasional rain.  This jacket handled all aspects admirably.  Using their sizing chart, size was perfect.  Jacket has a lot going for it, especially from a travel pespective:  It is easy to layer clothing underneath it, pockets are warm and lined, and something I found expecially helpful, was that the interior pocket is particularly deep.  Was great for gloves, paper items, etc. with no doubts about them staying in place.Coat is also excellent for when you have to change temps, such as you are going inside but still need to wear your coat.  It is light enough that it doesn't get in the way and you don't overheat with it on.  Bonus for the jacket was that it folds up well so that I could put it under the straps of my travel backpack and it would still fit inside the overhead bin.Got caught in the rain a couple of times (no surprise there) and it handled the rain extremely well, shedding the rain quickly and also drying quickly.Only minor negative (and it didn't impact me, but it might some) is that the zipper on the small pocket on the left sleeve (used for keys, etc.) had a habit of sliding open.  Again, no problem for me since I was not storing anything in there, but something to be aware of.All in all, an excellent purchase.

"Purchased Feb 2024 and by Nov 2024 with low to moderate use, the back where the heel goes has worn out and made the shoe uncomfortable. I untie my shoes when I take them off and use a shoe horn putting them on so this wear down is purely from the friction of my heel against the shoes from walking with the shoes laced up comfortably. For the price, I feel these shoes are expensive given their lack of durability.Before wearing out the shoes fit well, were very comfortable, and I felt like I had plenty of stability during my twelve hour work shifts. My feet did not hurt when I got home. The white looked very good when it was brand new.

"Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as lawn mowing shoes, as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's Try Before You Buy. Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers in my opinion heres some indepth info along with  pros and constldr great quality shoes for the price and easy to clean recommend to beginner and intermediate runnershikers experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of qualitypros perfect fit i usually wear  wide usa so that is what i ordered and it fit perfectly comfort and ease i like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off if you wish by the use of the heel pull tab the tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes which was a frequent problem with some other brands i have owned in the past easy to clean quality mesh i have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage ymmv but i didnt seem to have this issue and ive had these shoes for about a year imo i find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean which is essential for anyone like myself who often hikes or runs in forestrymud above average quality as for the year timeframe the st set was about  months of extreme use then i purchased a nd pair which ive had for about  months now this may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me i usually have to change shoes every  months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use i still have the st set which i use as lawn mowing shoes as they are still usable but the tread does not get much griptraction anymore for running i liked them enough to buy that nd pair instead of some other brandmodel decent arch support and sole tread you will find other shoes with the same or better but i didnt see many that were this cheap in price part of amazons try before you buy free tryons you can take up to  days to decide whether to keepreturn if you wish and only be charged if not returned by the th day day  is the day they are delivered uniform in color the shoe currently comes in allblack or allwhite including the logo ymmv but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring allblack shoes so i can also wear them leisurely at work if i choose im a mechanic great for anyone with the same issue or military etccons not the most expertelite quality shoe out there but will definitely check most peoples boxes for average needs imo cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes but as an avid runner the price is about average however they are usually on sale my st set was around  off which dropped it from something to  which was worth it for me nd set was about  off winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price tread pattern is smooth and circular instead of rigid and squaretriangle in case that matters to you in regards to rock climbing etcoverall i was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally but your mileage may vary,1

"I wanted to leave a review for these shoes specifically because Amazon has a habit of throwing old reviews at the buyer rather than more recent ones. There aren't many with a fair critique, or they resort to omg it sucks/rocks. So, here we go.After years of using TredSafe shoes due to just not having the money to afford fancy-shmancy, I bit the bullet on these shoes figuring I could at least default to other shoes if they didn't work out. Also, a lot of reviews complained on durability and such, but they were recommended, so I went for it.Durability: Uhhhh, folks must have run over their pairs with a lawn mower to get them wrecked like they were, because wow have mine been accidentally kicked into and scraped by a LOT of old metal equipment and hardware with basically no damage. Really, the only damage was a screw I somehow stepped on, drilling a hole into the bottom. I mean, it didn't poke my foot, so no harm done.Comfort: Okay, so memory foam is a big your mileage may vary situation, but generally the foam is pretty okay in these shoes. Seeing as I run around a lot more at my new job than I did my old one, these do pretty good at cushioning my 13W feet. Then again, I am also a tall dude, so the memory foam cushioning may not be as effective for me. It hasn't been long enough to really wear it out either, but again, your mileage may vary. Also depends on whether you really understand memory foam, which I kind of don't. I might be totally off-base.But anyways. Even without that, the general feel and support of the shoe is good. The fact that my heels basically never hurt after eight-hour shifts when they would tend to hurt in the old, cheap TredSafe shoes is a pretty good testament to that fact.The fit: It fits...? I mean, 13W feet, I bought 13W. It fit pretty much as expected. The only minor complaint I can make is more a special case: there isn't a lot of room for inserts. See, I'm weird and have a tendency to put more pressure on the front of my feet than the heel, and not a shoe can be found at reasonable price for someone weird like me. I'd like to be able to fit some front support into the shoes to counter that, but there's just not enough room. Maybe once I wear out the memory foam, but otherwise... Well, that's a me thing. If you walk like a normal person rather than like I did as a kid to catch late-night TV without being caught, then you should be okay.Other stuff: One other minor complaint is just a typical sneaker issue but a bit worse. When the bottoms of the shoes get wet, walking on any kind of hard floor gives off an obnoxious squeaking sound. I don't mean like basketball court squeaking. I mean like twisting leather squeaking. To be fair... They're sneakers. They'll make noise like that, but it's usually not that annoying. They do dry out pretty quick so long as you don't keep getting them wet, so it doesn't last particularly long.So... Four stars? Yeah. They're pretty good overall, and they sure do take a beating. I keep expecting something I do to rip it open, but there isn't a single tear or crack anywhere (besides the hole from the screw). Main problem is just memory foam getting in the way of using inserts, lack of front foot support for those like yours truly, and the obnoxious wet squeak. Still a solid shoe, though. Worth the money.Update: 07/22/2023Just bought a second pair because the pair I use finally showed signs of serious wear, which is pretty impressive since I've used these shoes for almost everything from job work to yard work. They have had their soles handed to them regularly and only just now started actually falling apart in any measure. They aren't dead just yet, but the shoes were on a good sale so I bought pair two ahead of time.I did end up wearing out the memory foam rather quick (but I also walk weird, so once again your mileage may vary) but pulling them out to replace with new inserts was really easy, so it was a simple swap-out. I will say it's best to just swap for more memory foam since other support inserts didn't help just because of the shoe's own support.So yeah, running back in to say you REALLY have to try to destroy these shoes to make them fall apart: for having lasted 3 years of me, they've done a very good job staying together. They're still comfortable, pretty good support, and make the annoying leather-twisting noise when wet, but I definitely think they're worth the price, sale or not.",i wanted to leave a review for these shoes specifically because amazon has a habit of throwing old reviews at the buyer rather than more recent ones there arent many with a fair critique or they resort to omg it sucksrocks so here we goafter years of using tredsafe shoes due to just not having the money to afford fancyshmancy i bit the bullet on these shoes figuring i could at least default to other shoes if they didnt work out also a lot of reviews complained on durability and such but they were recommended so i went for itdurability uhhhh folks must have run over their pairs with a lawn mower to get them wrecked like they were because wow have mine been accidentally kicked into and scraped by a lot of old metal equipment and hardware with basically no damage really the only damage was a screw i somehow stepped on drilling a hole into the bottom i mean it didnt poke my foot so no harm donecomfort okay so memory foam is a big your mileage may vary situation but generally the foam is pretty okay in these shoes seeing as i run around a lot more at my new job than i did my old one these do pretty good at cushioning my w feet then again i am also a tall dude so the memory foam cushioning may not be as effective for me it hasnt been long enough to really wear it out either but again your mileage may vary also depends on whether you really understand memory foam which i kind of dont i might be totally offbasebut anyways even without that the general feel and support of the shoe is good the fact that my heels basically never hurt after eighthour shifts when they would tend to hurt in the old cheap tredsafe shoes is a pretty good testament to that factthe fit it fits i mean w feet i bought w it fit pretty much as expected the only minor complaint i can make is more a special case there isnt a lot of room for inserts see im weird and have a tendency to put more pressure on the front of my feet than the heel and not a shoe can be found at reasonable price for someone weird like me id like to be able to fit some front support into the shoes to counter that but theres just not enough room maybe once i wear out the memory foam but otherwise well thats a me thing if you walk like a normal person rather than like i did as a kid to catch latenight tv without being caught then you should be okayother stuff one other minor complaint is just a typical sneaker issue but a bit worse when the bottoms of the shoes get wet walking on any kind of hard floor gives off an obnoxious squeaking sound i dont mean like basketball court squeaking i mean like twisting leather squeaking to be fair theyre sneakers theyll make noise like that but its usually not that annoying they do dry out pretty quick so long as you dont keep getting them wet so it doesnt last particularly longso four stars yeah theyre pretty good overall and they sure do take a beating i keep expecting something i do to rip it open but there isnt a single tear or crack anywhere besides the hole from the screw main problem is just memory foam getting in the way of using inserts lack of front foot support for those like yours truly and the obnoxious wet squeak still a solid shoe though worth the moneyupdate just bought a second pair because the pair i use finally showed signs of serious wear which is pretty impressive since ive used these shoes for almost everything from job work to yard work they have had their soles handed to them regularly and only just now started actually falling apart in any measure they arent dead just yet but the shoes were on a good sale so i bought pair two ahead of timei did end up wearing out the memory foam rather quick but i also walk weird so once again your mileage may vary but pulling them out to replace with new inserts was really easy so it was a simple swapout i will say its best to just swap for more memory foam since other support inserts didnt help just because of the shoes own supportso yeah running back in to say you really have to try to destroy these shoes to make them fall apart for having lasted  years of me theyve done a very good job staying together theyre still comfortable pretty good support and make the annoying leathertwisting noise when wet but i definitely think theyre worth the price sale or not,1

"I recently purchased the Champion Men's Midweight Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt, and I have to say it's one of the best basic tees I've owned. This shirt strikes the perfect balance between comfort, fit, and style, making it an essential wardrobe staple for men.First and foremost, the cotton fabric is of excellent quality. It's soft, breathable, and feels great against the skin. The midweight thickness is just right - not too heavy, not too light - making it suitable for year-round wear. Whether I wear it on its own during warmer months or layer it under a jacket in colder weather, it always feels comfortable and keeps me at the perfect temperature.The fit is spot on as well. The crewneck tee is cut in a way that offers a flattering shape without being too tight or too loose. The sleeves have just the right length, hitting the mid-bicep, which I find very comfortable and stylish.I also appreciate that Champion offers this tee in both regular and big & tall sizes, ensuring a perfect fit for all body types. The inclusivity in sizing is a big plus, and it's a testament to Champion's commitment to providing comfortable clothing for all men.The design is simple yet classic, with the iconic Champion logo subtly embroidered on the sleeve. This minimalistic approach allows the shirt to be versatile, easily paired with jeans, shorts, or activewear for various occasions.Moreover, this tee holds up well to washing and retains its shape and color. The durable construction and high-quality fabric ensure that it will last for a long time, making it a great investment.Overall, I highly recommend the Champion Men's Midweight Cotton Crewneck T-Shirt to any man looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and versatile basic tee.

"First  impressions: These jeans look great and fit well with a loose, comfortable feel—perfect for layering thermals in Korea’s colder months. I’m a fan of Levi’s (and still love them), but these cost only a quarter of the price. The material feels quite rough and stiff, so I washed them before wearing to see if they’d soften, but they haven’t yet.Since the previous pair ran slightly smaller, I gave it to my son and ordered another one (36” x 32”) for myself. This pair fits better, but I noticed the actual length is longer than usual compared to Levi’s, and the waist still runs slightly small. If you’re considering these jeans, keep the sizing differences in mind.

"Bought 2 on prime day. Seems like a quality shirt for the price. It’s your standard “American” boxy fit which works well with the dad bod I’m rocking these days. Soft, thin but not sheer and long enough to tuck. The latter is a huge plus as I normally have to buy tall sizes or golf specific polos to get a shirt that stays tucked. No shrinkage after the first wash but I wash cold and sensor dry low",bought  on prime day seems like a quality shirt for the price it’s your standard “american” boxy fit which works well with the dad bod i’m rocking these days soft thin but not sheer and long enough to tuck the latter is a huge plus as i normally have to buy tall sizes or golf specific polos to get a shirt that stays tucked no shrinkage after the first wash but i wash cold and sensor dry low,1

"These arrived today. They are so cute, light weight, great look but I was so bummed they had 3 deep scratches in the top of the right shoe. Makes me wonder if I received a returned product. Otherwise I really like them! They’re a good price and good dupe for birks. I don’t want to go through the hassle of a return though. The fit is true to size, light weight, and great color (matches pics online). I know from getting birks before they get more comfortable the more you wear them. Decent cushion inside the shoe though.After writing this review the company reached out to see how they could improve my experience. Happy to report they replaced the scratched shoes with a new pair that looks great! Very happy with them and the good customer service. Changed from 3 stars to 4.",these arrived today they are so cute light weight great look but i was so bummed they had  deep scratches in the top of the right shoe makes me wonder if i received a returned product otherwise i really like them they’re a good price and good dupe for birks i don’t want to go through the hassle of a return though the fit is true to size light weight and great color matches pics online i know from getting birks before they get more comfortable the more you wear them decent cushion inside the shoe thoughafter writing this review the company reached out to see how they could improve my experience happy to report they replaced the scratched shoes with a new pair that looks great very happy with them and the good customer service changed from  stars to ,1

"I been trying to look for pants that is slightly past the knee and I finally found it in these Volcom shorts. The quality is awesome. It has a thickness to it that you know will last. The only thing that was a bit odd was the amount of loose threads I had to cut off these shorts. Some of the threads weren't even connected to the shorts but a lot of them were longer threads so it did look a little messy but once I snipped all of them off, the shorts looked really good. It must have been a quality control thing. They made some of the threads too long at the factory.Anyway, the fit is really good and I'm used to the more baggy style and wanted something to go past my knee. These do that perfectly. It's not too baggy or too long. It's just right in my opinion. I liked it so much I was able to pick up 2 more on the lightning deals for about $25 each. My main concern was how these fit after you wash them as a lot of other shorts I have bought in the past have shrunk a lot after washing and the fit was so different. These pretty much held the same fit before and after washing it so that's how I knew, I needed to get more of these shorts before the sale was over. I highly recommend you try these if you haven't already.

"I really like these pants. I ordered one pair in white and another in gray, which is a very light colored gray. I like to wear these type of pants around the beach or resorts we visit, as I’m not a big fan of using sunscreen. Having had skin cancer dug out me for the last 10 years from too many years of excessive sun exposure here in Southern California, these pants give me some protection from that. I realize these would most likely have a low SPF rating in regards to sunblocking, but that’s fine, as I don’t sit out in direct sun all that long anyway when I go places. I do have sun blocking hiking type pants when I do need something like that. I also realize that you still need a certain amount of vitamin D that the sun provides naturally, so these fit the bill in that regard. I like their loose fit, and being all cotton, they dry fast as well if you do get them wet.I’m 6’ 1” / 195 lbs. and normally wear a size 34 waist with a 32 inseam in low waisted jeans. The size large I ordered in these pants seem to fit me just right with a good length to them. Being that they are all cotton, I plan on washing them on a cold cycle and hang drying them to keep them from shrinking up. I would highly recommend these pants, as I am more than satisfied with their quality and fit.",i really like these pants i ordered one pair in white and another in gray which is a very light colored gray i like to wear these type of pants around the beach or resorts we visit as i’m not a big fan of using sunscreen having had skin cancer dug out me for the last  years from too many years of excessive sun exposure here in southern california these pants give me some protection from that i realize these would most likely have a low spf rating in regards to sunblocking but that’s fine as i don’t sit out in direct sun all that long anyway when i go places i do have sun blocking hiking type pants when i do need something like that i also realize that you still need a certain amount of vitamin d that the sun provides naturally so these fit the bill in that regard i like their loose fit and being all cotton they dry fast as well if you do get them weti’m ’ ”   lbs and normally wear a size  waist with a  inseam in low waisted jeans the size large i ordered in these pants seem to fit me just right with a good length to them being that they are all cotton i plan on washing them on a cold cycle and hang drying them to keep them from shrinking up i would highly recommend these pants as i am more than satisfied with their quality and fit,1

"It’s exactly as described. Lightweight, packable jacket. Comes with compression sack. Where I live it’s common for the temperature to be below freezing most of the winter and I use this coat the entire winter. I wouldn’t sit outside with it being that cold but as long as you’re active you’ll be warm. It holds your body heat really well when you’re active.  It sheds water and snow pretty good and blocks a lot of wind. The turtle neck/neck warmer is a really nice feature. The pockets are nice and roomy.

The shoes slip on and off easily, are incredibly comfortable with excellent arch support and a padded sole, and fit true to size.  I ordered my usual size and they fit perfectly.

"I recently purchased this Under Armour Men's Tech Golf Polo, and I must say, I am extremely pleased with this product. From the moment I put it on, I knew I had made an excellent choice.The first thing that struck me was the quality and thickness of the fabric. It feels durable and well-made, providing a sense of confidence that it will withstand regular wear and tear. The material is soft against the skin and has a slight stretch, making it incredibly comfortable to move around in, whether I'm on the golf course or at work.The detailing on this polo is top-notch. Under Armour has paid attention to the little things that elevate the overall look, giving it a sophisticated and polished appearance. The subtle logo and design elements add just the right amount of flair without being too flashy, making it suitable for various occasions.One of the things I love about this polo is its versatility. It truly fits the dress-casual category, making it suitable for both professional settings and leisure activities. I can easily wear it to the office with a pair of slacks, and then transition seamlessly to a round of golf without feeling out of place.I was so impressed with the first one that I also purchased this polo in multiple colors. Each one looks fantastic, and having a few in the rotation has become a staple in my wardrobe. It's one less thing to worry about when getting dressed, as I know I'll always look put together and stylish with these shirts. I can't explain it, but I feel more confident when I wear this polo.The fit of the Under Armour Tech Golf Polo is spot on. It's not too loose or tight, providing a flattering silhouette that enhances my physique. What's more, I appreciate that it didn't shrink after washing, maintaining its original fit and shape, which is essential for a garment I plan to wear frequently.As for the price, it is reasonable considering the quality and versatility of the product. It's evident that this polo is built to last, making it a worthwhile investment in my wardrobe.In conclusion, the Under Armour Men's Tech Golf Polo is a winner on all fronts. Its excellent quality, thickness, and attention to detail make it a standout choice for anyone looking to add a touch of sophistication to their wardrobe. The ability to dress it up for work or dress it down for play makes it a highly versatile piece. With a great fit and exceptional comfort, it's a pleasure to wear all day long. I highly recommend this polo to anyone seeking a reliable, stylish, and comfortable addition to their clothing collection.

"These fit my husband like a dream. He’s about 180lb, 6ft, and has slimmer legs/seat. The 32 fit him perfectly because of the stretchy waist. If it wasn’t for that it wouldn’t button at all as his waist is actually about 38-39inches so the stretch was impressive. He decided to size down because of the reviews. They don’t look transparent although Ill know better after we go on our tropical trip and spend some time in the sunlight. I’ll also know better about quality after the wash. Extremely affordable for the casual yet nice look they give. Super happy.

"For a long time I didn‚Äôt see the appeal in joggers until my gf bought me some.

"I just purchased more because they are like $8 cheaper than anywhere else. Wrangler has so many different styles and fits that you need to know what you need to get. Ok example Ariat M4 I wear 42x32, on cinch black label same 40x32. Wrangler 20x relaxed 40x32, on the wrangler 13MWZ pre-washed indigo, stoned washed tan and all other washes 44x32 these don’t shrink much. For the wrangler 13MWZ rigid indigo 46x32 they do shrink but not that much. So rigids after the initial treatment they shrink to a 45x31 the only thing if you know the original cowboy cut these are high rise jeans so they go higher up on the waist, the thighs are relaxed but not straight leg, they stack on boots(depending on the stack you want that is how long you get them) I do like stacked jeans but not a lot of material. Because of the larger size I get on these jeans the waist is fine, the length is fine but the thighs feel a little more loose, but I have tried the 44x32 and they feel tight after I shrink and break them in. They are easy to break in for the first wear, this is what I do. Flip the jeans inside out( this is the only way you should be washing jeans)I wash them on the heavy cycle with hot water, then dry them in dryer on hot cycle. Get them out throw them in the washer again same hot cycle, get them out dry again in hot cycle. The first two rounds no laundry detergent the 3 round I add detergent and a dryer sheet on the dryer, I don’t complete the last dryer cycle I take them out after 10 minutes and air dry them. After you do this they are way softer they have shrunk enough and fit way better. So if you want a tighter fit go with your regular size, if you like a little space go up one size. They will shrink just a bit more after that but it is not very noticeable. Ok now that they are ready,  wear them a couple of times before you wash them again if they start to smell air them out. If you don’t stink them up go as many wears as you can. Next time you need to wash them flip them inside out zipped them up button them up throw them in the delicate cycle with cold water setting with very little detergent try not to use laundry softener. Take them out of washer and air dry them inside your house, try not to sun dry. If you need to use dryer on an emergency use the lowest setting possible. They last a while and better if you have several pairs on rotation I always have 5-6 pairs on rotation so they don’t get washed often once they need washing I get another 5-6 pairs an start rotation on those. I have pairs that are pretty old. You dye these pants if you need to but the natural worn use gives them personality.",i just purchased more because they are like  cheaper than anywhere else wrangler has so many different styles and fits that you need to know what you need to get ok example ariat m i wear x on cinch black label same x wrangler x relaxed x on the wrangler mwz prewashed indigo stoned washed tan and all other washes x these don’t shrink much for the wrangler mwz rigid indigo x they do shrink but not that much so rigids after the initial treatment they shrink to a x the only thing if you know the original cowboy cut these are high rise jeans so they go higher up on the waist the thighs are relaxed but not straight leg they stack on bootsdepending on the stack you want that is how long you get them i do like stacked jeans but not a lot of material because of the larger size i get on these jeans the waist is fine the length is fine but the thighs feel a little more loose but i have tried the x and they feel tight after i shrink and break them in they are easy to break in for the first wear this is what i do flip the jeans inside out this is the only way you should be washing jeansi wash them on the heavy cycle with hot water then dry them in dryer on hot cycle get them out throw them in the washer again same hot cycle get them out dry again in hot cycle the first two rounds no laundry detergent the  round i add detergent and a dryer sheet on the dryer i don’t complete the last dryer cycle i take them out after  minutes and air dry them after you do this they are way softer they have shrunk enough and fit way better so if you want a tighter fit go with your regular size if you like a little space go up one size they will shrink just a bit more after that but it is not very noticeable ok now that they are ready  wear them a couple of times before you wash them again if they start to smell air them out if you don’t stink them up go as many wears as you can next time you need to wash them flip them inside out zipped them up button them up throw them in the delicate cycle with cold water setting with very little detergent try not to use laundry softener take them out of washer and air dry them inside your house try not to sun dry if you need to use dryer on an emergency use the lowest setting possible they last a while and better if you have several pairs on rotation i always have  pairs on rotation so they don’t get washed often once they need washing i get another  pairs an start rotation on those i have pairs that are pretty old you dye these pants if you need to but the natural worn use gives them personality,1

"Soft, cute, long enough for the taller ladies - wrinkle free.  Bought it for my cruise and will love wearing it with a floppy hat.

"We have a Newfoundland dog who loves to sky-watch at night in the backyard while taking his time to do his business.

I’m not gonna lie I was feeling myself and bought this shirt to look buff and assuming you’re purchasing this shirt you are as well.Material: The material for this shirt is good and allows for stretching but not a lot of stretching. It’s also breathable and feels good on the skinSmell: The smell is alright for a shirt. Smells typical.Thickness: It’s not thick at all and good for sports and working out. **If you have a bit of a gut it will show**Size: This shirt is true to size towards your normal shirt. If you wear baggy clothes do not order the same size. Finally this shirt fits more for people who are taller/weigh more. For an example I ordered a Large and I’m 6’1 178lbs (Yes I am skinny) and the shirt fits slightly long on me length wise.

"I've worn Levi 517 boot cut jeans my entire adult life, but in the last few years I've notice a marked decline in their quality and ease of tearing and wearing, so I've been trying to find alternatives. Landed on these Carhartt jeans because they are one of the few still sewing in 7 belt loops and have always had a good reputation. Well, these are still holding up longer than the previous pair of Levi's! I do a lot of metal work and bending/squatting and a fair amount of trying to maneuver around mildly pointy bits of miscellaneous materials in tight spaces, but haven't had a single puncture or rip. Waist sits right, pockets aren't paper thin inside like some other brands, they're comfortable, cost a little less, and the color hasn't even run out with washing and scrubbing diesel soot out!

"I really like these jeans. I have ordered many colors over the years and they hold up well. I have short legs so being able to get a 29 in length is great for me since they are hard to find in others brands. I really like the slim fit, no too skinny and not too baggy. My only complaint is with the colors, what you think you are ordering and what you get are often different.  Names like “Dark Hollow” aren’t very descriptive. Somewhere they should elaborate that Dark Hollow is basically black with a hint of dark blue. But if you don’t like the color you can always return them.  They could save some costs in returns if they did a better job showing/describing  colors. Can be pricey so wait for the good sales.",i really like these jeans i have ordered many colors over the years and they hold up well i have short legs so being able to get a  in length is great for me since they are hard to find in others brands i really like the slim fit no too skinny and not too baggy my only complaint is with the colors what you think you are ordering and what you get are often different  names like “dark hollow” aren’t very descriptive somewhere they should elaborate that dark hollow is basically black with a hint of dark blue but if you don’t like the color you can always return them  they could save some costs in returns if they did a better job showingdescribing  colors can be pricey so wait for the good sales,1

My husband has been wearing Rockports for over 30 years - never had a problem before.  These have been worn only a few months - both have the same problem - soles separating and flapping when he walks.  VERY disappointed - what happened to Rockport quality?Could have been a bad batch of glue?I took photos and contacted Rockport directly on their website late in the afternoon (well past 7 pm eastern time) - and received a sympathetic and apologetic response within FIVE minutes! They said they would send me replacement shoes but couldn’t find details of my order (I’d bought in US on Amazon and was contacting Rockport Canada). I sent a copy of my Amazon invoice and explained where I’d bought and thought they’d use that as the reason they couldn’t help - but NO - another response in less than five minutes - they would forward to warranty department and I should hear from them. Which I did - less than an hour later! They didn’t have the same shoe in stock - but a gift card for the purchase price was an option or select a different style - just let them know. I have never received such excellent online customer service. I believe in supporting companies that stand behind their products and provide service - especially prompt and sympathetic service!

"I'm writing this review for those of you wondering if these are similar to the chubbies everywear shorts. I'll do a more in depth comparison, but from a high level they are extremely similar! There are a couple differences between them highlighted below. I have also included several pictures with direct comparison to actual chubbies which are my favorite shorts that I've been wearing for the past year or so. I snagged these up on prime day looking for a much cheaper alternative to my favorite chubbies shorts. These are super close for a fraction of the price.Biggest differences; maamgic is slightly longer (more material) overall despite having a half inch shorter inseam. Maamgic has also added a couple features not on the chubbies; metal tips on the drawstring, small key ring/loop on the front right belt loop, an additional 'change' pocket sown into the front left pocket. Maamgic also uses 90% polyester and 10% spandex, where chubbies is 89% polyester and 11% elasthanne.Minor differences; I would also say the threads and seams are a little more noticeable and visible on the maamgic depending on the colorway you choose. They only have one color for the drawstrings of the maamgic, if that matters to you. The chubbies have a slightly softer feel to them and less shiny looking, this could be that I've washed and been wearing the chubbies for awhile where I just got the maamgic shorts. The maamgic comes with a small elastic cord attached to the rear zipper pocket. There is also a slightly different tint to the similar colors of each brand just based on the materials they use.Maamgic pros; price ($37 difference), slightly longer overall, added belt loop key ring, metal drawstrings tips, added 'change' pocket inside front pocket, great basic colorways.Chubbies pros; name brand, slighter higher build quality (threads, seams, material & zippers etc) and overall softer feel, cool names for, along with, more colorways and patterns, both 6 inch and 8 inch inseam options.So if you're looking for a much cheaper alternative to chubbies everywear shorts, this is it! I plan to buy several in the colorways I'm missing from chubbies. I can't comment on the long term use of the maamgic compared to chubbies but I hope they hold up and last just as long!

Love these jeans!! So comfortable. I am 5' 5 and 180 lbs so I bought 14 long. They fit perfectly. I bought  one lighter pair and one dark pair. The dark pair will need to be washed a couple of more times due to dye coming off on my hands. They fit perfectly and do not dig in anywhere. Fabric is a nice quality not cheap looking or feeling. Would recommend these jeans to anyone looking to replace their worn out favorite Jeans.,love these jeans so comfortable i am   and  lbs so i bought  long they fit perfectly i bought  one lighter pair and one dark pair the dark pair will need to be washed a couple of more times due to dye coming off on my hands they fit perfectly and do not dig in anywhere fabric is a nice quality not cheap looking or feeling would recommend these jeans to anyone looking to replace their worn out favorite jeans,1

These are not the same material so I was a little disappointed in that, but other than that they are comfortable to wear Use them at work and they do look nice so you could definitely use them to go out. I personally don’t play golf so I can’t testify how good they are as actual golf pants but as work pants or slack substitutes definitely worth it especially for the price range. The fit is very true to size so make sure you get your actual size if anything, maybe get a waistband above one because they aren’t as elastic as they are advertised, which is the only thing I got disappointed in but since I bought my actual size, I’m actually able to fit it without a belt.",first off i’m gonna go off by saying these pants are extremely affordable actually bought them twice because they’re so affordable for work purposes i have a pair of golf pants from old navy that i really like and it has like moisture wicking type material but looks like slacks these are not the same material so i was a little disappointed in that but other than that they are comfortable to wear use them at work and they do look nice so you could definitely use them to go out i personally don’t play golf so i can’t testify how good they are as actual golf pants but as work pants or slack substitutes definitely worth it especially for the price range the fit is very true to size so make sure you get your actual size if anything maybe get a waistband above one because they aren’t as elastic as they are advertised which is the only thing i got disappointed in but since i bought my actual size i’m actually able to fit it without a belt,1

If they still fit the same after the second wash I will buy more. The waist will not slide down when bending over cause the waist band comes up to my belly button. The waist band is 2 1/4 inches wide, so I folded over one time for a waist fit. Good waist band. No need to thigh strings. Why not 5 stars? Because the cuff has no real elastic.

"Shirts are very comfortable, and surprisingly warm when using them as under-layers on cold days.  This is particularly nice as their thin material allows layering without undue bulkiness.  Also, the slick polyester makes sliding your arms into the sleeves of outer clothing (especially fleece-lined ones) easier than cotton, which tends to get hung up.The one-star deduction is because the sleeves are too long for the size, although I was able to mitigate that by deliberately shrinking them in the wash with hot water and high-temp drying, which shortened the sleeves to a manageable length without causing the rest of the shirt to become too small.Overall, a good product at a very reasonable price.",shirts are very comfortable and surprisingly warm when using them as underlayers on cold days  this is particularly nice as their thin material allows layering without undue bulkiness  also the slick polyester makes sliding your arms into the sleeves of outer clothing especially fleecelined ones easier than cotton which tends to get hung upthe onestar deduction is because the sleeves are too long for the size although i was able to mitigate that by deliberately shrinking them in the wash with hot water and hightemp drying which shortened the sleeves to a manageable length without causing the rest of the shirt to become too smalloverall a good product at a very reasonable price,1

"This jacket is a pretty outstanding value, even though it’s more than I needed. I purchased three in hopes that they were lighter—more like a top to wear over a t-shirt. As a fleece, this is pretty heavy, like a light coat. The tail comes down to mid butt and the sleeves are perfect—just a tad long on my average arms. At 5’9” and 155, I almost always wear small and these smalls fit with room to easily wear a couple base layers or a sweatshirt underneath. Not as soft as I was hoping for—again, was thinking more of a top, not a coat—but reasonably soft for a jacket. Looks just fine. Was at an outdoor sports store and compared this to a Patagonia offering that was very similar in quality and feel. Zippers all work just fine. The bonus inner pockets do (inexplicably!) have holes in them large enough to lose your AirPods case, but good for larger things like hat, gloves, trail map, or cell phone. I wore one over a wool tshirt for a mountain hike. 30 degrees with 15 mph winds in the Boulder Flatirons. Overall just a little chilly after working up my body heat during a 2 hour hike.  I didn’t really need any more jackets but made room in the rotation for these. Smoking deal for what I paid!",this jacket is a pretty outstanding value even though it’s more than i needed i purchased three in hopes that they were lighter—more like a top to wear over a tshirt as a fleece this is pretty heavy like a light coat the tail comes down to mid butt and the sleeves are perfect—just a tad long on my average arms at ’” and  i almost always wear small and these smalls fit with room to easily wear a couple base layers or a sweatshirt underneath not as soft as i was hoping for—again was thinking more of a top not a coat—but reasonably soft for a jacket looks just fine was at an outdoor sports store and compared this to a patagonia offering that was very similar in quality and feel zippers all work just fine the bonus inner pockets do inexplicably have holes in them large enough to lose your airpods case but good for larger things like hat gloves trail map or cell phone i wore one over a wool tshirt for a mountain hike  degrees with  mph winds in the boulder flatirons overall just a little chilly after working up my body heat during a  hour hike  i didn’t really need any more jackets but made room in the rotation for these smoking deal for what i paid,1

"I bought two pairs, one in blue and one in jeans blue. I have a small waist with a bigger bum and they fit like a glove. I usually wear a size 6-8 and I bought a size 6 which is perfect!

"If you’re debating between these CRZ Yoga’s Hybrid Workout Shorts and their higher priced Casual Thicker Shorts, here’s the real scoop from someone who lives out of a suitcase:The Hybrid Workout Shorts are your go-to for almost anything. They’re lightweight, slightly tapered at the back for a clean look, and so versatile I wear them everywhere—from the gym to the grocery store. They pack so small, you can take several pairs without sacrificing space.However, the Casual Thicker Shorts, while incredibly comfortable and slightly more polished in appearance, have a downside. They’re bulkier, making them less ideal for a tightly packed bag. Plus, I found a slight inconsistency with one pair where the pocket didn’t sit flush against the hips, which could be annoying.Bottom line: For the active traveler or anyone with limited packing space, the Hybrid Shorts are a no-brainer. They’re multifunctional and efficient. Choose the Casual Shorts if you’re not pressed for space and prioritize comfort over convenience.

They still look as good as the day I got them. It's like having indestructible leg armor.**They Make You Look Taller:** I don't know if it's the magic of Levi's, but these jeans make me look taller. I mean, who wouldn't want a few extra inches without wearing heels? It's like an optical illusion for your legs.**Versatile as a Swiss Army Knife:** These jeans go with everything. I've paired them with t-shirts, dress shirts, and even a Hawaiian shirt once (don't judge). They're like the chameleon of my wardrobe, always fitting right in.In conclusion, if you're a guy like me who's always been on the fence about slim fit jeans, do yourself a favor and give these Signature by Levi Strauss & Co Men's Slim Fit Jeans a shot.

The linen fabric is breathable and comfortable, keeping me cool even on the warmest days.

"Recently, I was officially diagnosed with plantar fasciitis while also being diagnosed with Tarsal tunnel syndrome, oh and my great toe started hurting. Both feet. Ugh! some of the worse foot pain out there.Three things: 1) I went up a half size because EVERYTHING about both my feet were hurting.2)I have soooo many sneakers/ clogs/ shoes for work at between $100 to $180 apiece, it gives privileged, overindulgent to the uninformed: The reality is that I kept buying different shoes seeking to relieve the pain of feeling like Ive been standing on nails.3) I finally decided on Try before you buy tried and eventually bought these on the advice of my foot and ankle specialist. Best decision.For the first time in the last two or more years  I've worn the same shoe to work for two weeks. (I work three to four 12hr shifts/week.)Here's why, I like a soft padded foot bed, particularly at my heels. These are abundantly padded.  HOWEVER; foot specialist, and Physical therapist informed me that plantar fasciitis needs a firm foot bed with adequate arch support for relief.  Uhmmmm!!! But how's this for plot twist: My podiatrist ordered me custom inserts, five weeks later they arrive, and they are FIRM! he fits them OVER the inserts of these sneakers and voilà! I now have my plush padded foot bed, good ankle support while the shoe is deep enough to accept a custom insert without unnatural pressure at the arch, toe box, top or ball of foot. In fact I do NOT feel the inserts at all.  I think my decision to go up half size may have helped the insert fit. Shoes still are bigger but does not feel loose or unstable. These are breathable and stylish even for my sz 11 feet AND I went up a half size.  Great shoe.

"Iâ€™ve always wanted a classic pair of white high-top Converse, so I decided to finally grab a pair to see if they lived up to the hype. The shoes fit true to size for me. Theyâ€™re snug at first, but the canvas material softens after a few wears, making them more comfortable. I wouldnâ€™t say theyâ€™re the most cushioned shoes, but theyâ€™re perfect for casual wear.The classic white color makes these sneakers incredibly versatile. They go with almost anythingâ€”jeans, shorts, skirts, or even a casual dress. They add a cool, laid-back vibe to any outfit.As expected, white shoes do show dirt easily, but they clean up pretty well with a bit of soap and water. Iâ€™ve worn them quite a few times, and the soles and stitching have held up without any noticeable wear or tears.The quality feels solid, as youâ€™d expect from Converse. The canvas is durable, and the rubber soles are sturdy. They feel like theyâ€™ll last for a long time if properly cared for.Since theyâ€™re made of canvas, these sneakers are breathable, making them comfortable for warmer weather. Iâ€™ve worn them for hours, and my feet havenâ€™t gotten too hot or sweaty.Overall, Iâ€™m really happy with these white high-top Converse. Theyâ€™re stylish, comfortable, and versatile enough to wear every day.

They are true to size and always look great. I will throw a sport jacket on for a Saturday night or pretty much any event, no more suits for me.

"I buy 5 of these at a time, wear them outside all week at work, and then toss them once the Florida sun has had its way with them.

"Best quality shirts and affordable. Only downside is the buttons aren’t the best quality, and in two of five shirts I’ve ordered, the collar button has came off with light pressure. Bring to a tailor to fix for $5 so it’s not a big deal. Otherwise, these shirts after ironing once, they’re good to go. You don’t need to iron again, at least in my experience. Everytime they come out the washer dryer, they’ve had no wrinkles nor shrinkage which is great.I have many van Heusen and Calvin Klein shirts which are more expensive, but everytime they came out the wash/dryer they are wrinkly. Obviously the less maintenance the better as long as it maintains quality. So these are definitely the best shirts. FYI this is my first ever review, bc that’s how great these are!

"These shoes are an absolute game-changer for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet. As someone who works in a busy restaurant, I needed a shoe that could provide both comfort and support for long shifts, and the Skechers Men's Nampa Groton delivers in spades.Here's what I love about them: * Comfort: The memory foam insole is like walking on clouds. It molds to your feet and provides incredible cushioning, even after hours of wear. I no longer dread the end of my shift with aching feet. * Support: Despite the plush insole, these shoes offer excellent support. My feet feel secure and stable, which is crucial when navigating a slippery kitchen floor. * Slip-Resistance: Speaking of slippery floors, the slip-resistant outsole is a lifesaver. I've never felt more confident moving around, even with spills and grease. * Durability: I've been wearing these shoes for several months now, and they still look and feel great. The synthetic leather upper is easy to clean and shows no signs of wear and tear. * Style: Let's be honest, nobody wants to wear clunky work shoes. The Nampa Groton has a sleek, sporty design that looks good both on and off the job.Overall:I can't recommend the Skechers Men's Nampa Groton enough. They're comfortable, supportive, slip-resistant, and stylish â€“ everything you could want in a work shoe. If you're on your feet all day, do yourself a favor and invest in a pair. Your feet will thank you!Additional Notes: * I found the sizing to be accurate. * The shoes are lightweight and breathable. * They're easy to slip on and off, which is convenient for busy days. * I've received several compliments on their appearance.In short, these shoes are a winner!",these shoes are an absolute gamechanger for anyone who spends a lot of time on their feet as someone who works in a busy restaurant i needed a shoe that could provide both comfort and support for long shifts and the skechers mens nampa groton delivers in spadesheres what i love about them  comfort the memory foam insole is like walking on clouds it molds to your feet and provides incredible cushioning even after hours of wear i no longer dread the end of my shift with aching feet  support despite the plush insole these shoes offer excellent support my feet feel secure and stable which is crucial when navigating a slippery kitchen floor  slipresistance speaking of slippery floors the slipresistant outsole is a lifesaver ive never felt more confident moving around even with spills and grease  durability ive been wearing these shoes for several months now and they still look and feel great the synthetic leather upper is easy to clean and shows no signs of wear and tear  style lets be honest nobody wants to wear clunky work shoes the nampa groton has a sleek sporty design that looks good both on and off the joboveralli cant recommend the skechers mens nampa groton enough theyre comfortable supportive slipresistant and stylish â€“ everything you could want in a work shoe if youre on your feet all day do yourself a favor and invest in a pair your feet will thank youadditional notes  i found the sizing to be accurate  the shoes are lightweight and breathable  theyre easy to slip on and off which is convenient for busy days  ive received several compliments on their appearancein short these shoes are a winner,1

"For that price you can't beat it. I'm not a fancy guy anyway so I guess it doesn't matter but I do like clothes that are comfortable and fit how I thought they would. I am 6ft tall and weight about 145 lbs so I'm slim, I ordered 7 of these sweatshirts and each 1 of them is exactly the same. I ordered them in Large and they are absolutely perfect fit. Not tight but not baggy. Sleeve length is plenty long enough so the wrist cuff isn't sliding up the arm. Idk why some reviews are complaining about the wrists being tight I think that's how they should be and in reality they're not even that tight. The neck is snug it's not all baggy and if you wear a t shirt underneath it definitely won't show. Other than the fact it's made of recycled plastic it's a dope sweatshirt.

"Not enough people put their body dimensions on here to make sizing an unseen/unknown shirt easy.I'm a guy - so I don't care if you know my specs - here they are:6' 5"" tall310 lbs23"" technical torso measurement (back of neck to waist line)21"" armpit to waist line54"" chest18"" pythons (biceps for you skinny hipsters)Usually I buy shirts in 2 XL, 2 XLT, or 3X.Normally I buy shirts with the ""tall"" designation since my gut sticking out typically makes a ""non-tall"" shirt rise just to the point of showing skin when I lean back or reach up with my arm(s). No one wants to see that - unless that is your ""thing""I went with the 2XLT version of this as a baseline.Results:100% cotton shrinks even if it ""preshrunk."" Pre-shrunk does not shrink as much, but there is a noticeable shrink none the less.New from package w/ no wash - length was fine - fit was snug, but not too much to show off the moobs or gut too badly.First wash - length still fine - fit was too tight - moobs and gut sticking out like an over packed sausage - not flattering.-You can pull the shirts to stretch it out to be less form fitting, but I don't want to mess with that after every wash.Returned both 2 XLT's and went with a 3X regular length.3X reg length is good enough (unless reaching with arms up as far as I can) - fit is quite loose on the moobs and gut (read comfortable and flattering), but not to tent proportions.Shirt really is heavyweight and I love it. Can't see through it and looks like it will last a while, just like most Dickies items do!Pocket is a touch too tight/small for my Galaxy S5 with case since they seamed in a dedicated pen/pencil pouch inside the total front pocket dimensions. As is, it is good enough to hold a couple pens or something along the size of a deck of cards.Ask your grandma, mother, or wife for a seam ripper to remove the Dickies tag on the front pocket. If they are good with the stitch, ask them to rip out the dedicated pen/pencil pouch and the pocket becomes big enough for a smart phone.I used to buy Fruit of the Loom Men's Short Sleeved Pocket T-Shirt from both the Normal and Best collections since they used to be available locally in a ""mart"" store. That Wal place doesn't carry the front pocket shirt in my sizes anymore so I found them here on Amazon. FotL changed their material/construction practices with this shirt recently and they are bad quality, even at $5-$8 a pop.

"Amazon’s sizing recommendations state that these run small, but that hasn’t been my experience. Wrangler has the most consistent sizing of just about any brand that I wear. These fit just like all of my other Wrangler jeans.These are a lighter weight denim, which I prefer in Arizona. And all stretch denim is more susceptible to rips/tears, but these compare favorably to similar jeans that I have from Flag & Anthem, Levi’s & Rock & Roll Denim if you are familiar with the stretch denim offerings from any of them.Overall, very comfortable, well-fitting jeans. I spend a lot of time getting in and out of my truck all day & these have just the right amount of stretch to not bind up, if you know what I mean, and I think you do.Some color options are overpriced, but that’s Amazon for you.

"We purchased several packs of these onesies for our newborn, and indeed, onesies proved to be the go-to outfit for hanging out at home and for layering when we go out.  They are easy to put on and take off and they snap securely at the bottom.Some positives about these Gerber onesies:1) They are solidly made.  So far we have not had any rip or tear.  Admittedly our infant isn't playing rugby in them, but in the course of everyday wear they are holding up admirably.2) The three snaps at the bottom are secure but not so tight that they are difficult to fasten.3) The ""lap shoulder neckline"" (i.e. overlapping fabric on either side of the neck) make it relatively easy to slip over your baby's head.4) The white cotton is slightly transparent, which makes it easy to see the blue indicator line on diapers with the color-change feature.  (""Honey, we have a blue stripe situation here!"")5) They are very reasonably priced.A few things to know:1) Being cotton, these do shrink a bit.  No big surprise there.2) The Gerber onesies seem to run a bit small, at least in comparison with several other brands we have used.  Our baby was 8 1/2 lbs at birth and 21 inches long, and she basically skipped the 0-3 month size.  At 10 weeks of age she was ready for the 6-9 month size.

"I purchased two of these “Midi” dresses~~one in light blue and one in green. The colors were so absolutely gorgeous in the pictures and on the models, and I was looking so forward to receiving them in a MIDI size that would not be too long on me!!! The models in the pictures wearing “this” dress have the bottom of their legs showing, as though these truly are MIDI size in length!!! However, THESE DRESSES GO TO THE FLOOR ON ME!!! There is no possible way I could wear them even if I wanted to!!! I also DO NOT WANT TO WEAR THEM SINCE THE COLORS ARE NOT AT ALL AS PICTURED!!! They are dull and boring and just look “BLAH!!!” I had ordered a green one last year from a different vendor and the color did not arrive as pictured in that one either, but I thought I would keep it because it at least looks like it could appear as green. I deeply regret keeping that one also!!! The dresses are WAY TOO LONG and THE COLORS ARE WAY TOO DRAB AND UGLY!!! I love the pattern on the dresses and I love how the sleeves and the bottom ruffle are sheer with the pattern still covering them, but these dresses just do not live up to the pictures at all!!! I am SO ABSOLUTELY DISAPPOINTED IN THESE DRESSES!!! I returned them both!!! This is false advertising when they show the beautiful colors of the dresses on the screen, but the pictures IRL are almost colorless!!! They are also describing these dresses as “MIDI” length, and you can see the models’ legs at the bottom of the dress, BUT THEY DO NOT MATCH THE COLORS OR THE DESCRIPTIONS OF EITHER!!! Don’t waste your money~~you’ll have to return them anyway. Also, if you’re like me, I feel so disappointed to have found these gorgeous dresses yet find the real thing nothing like it was described and pictured!!!

"The basic fit is similar to basic white FTL cotton briefs.  So if those fit, these should be the same in terms of fit and comfort.I've had them for a couple of years and have been able to see the durability.  The first thing that's noticeable is that the FRUIT OF THE LOOM printing (light grey over charcoal grey) around the waistband will start fading.  Definitely faster if it's machine washed.  The tagless washing instructions are printed on the cotton, and may be difficult to read and will likely be unreadable after multiple washings.  After a while some of the elastic material starting breaking and popping out through the band, especially at the edge of the band but sometimes in the middle.  That's probably just normal wear for any underwear, but these seemed to wear rather fast.  I can't feel them anyways and however much elastic is broken isn't enough to affect the fit.The inside of the band is soft/fuzzy and comfortable, but after enough washings it will start to pill up.  Not a huge deal.  The blue colors will fade (like a dark cotton T-shirt) after enough washings, but that's normal for dark colored cotton.I like them enough (and it looks like the design/materials haven't changed since my last package) that I bought another pack.

"I recently purchased the Amazon Essentials Men's Packable Lightweight Water-Resistant Puffer Jacket, and I’m thoroughly impressed with its quality and versatility. Here’s my experience:Fit and Comfort: I bought the Big & Tall size, and it fits perfectly! The cut is flattering without feeling too snug, and there’s plenty of room for layering underneath if needed. The elastic cuffs are a nice touch, keeping the cold air out.Warmth and Weather Resistance: For such a lightweight jacket, it’s surprisingly warm. I’ve worn it in temperatures as low as [insert approximate temperature] with just a sweater underneath, and it kept me cozy. The water-resistant feature worked well during light rain, keeping me dry without compromising breathability.Portability: This is one of the best features.

"Nautica Men's Short Sleeve Solid Stretch Cotton Pique Polo Shirt in Bright Cobalt.  Nautica is one of my go-to brands, because I generally like their materials, look, and fit.  I have not come across the material that this polo is made out of before.  The material is a stretch material, and it stretches pretty easily with movement, in a good way.  The material seems decent.  It's not too thin, and I like the stretchiness to it for movement.  The color is true to the image.  The one issue I am running into is the shoulders are very boxy.  Where the top shoulder stitching is it steaks straight out left and right, so it gives it this very boxy squared off look that is not good.  I don't know if it is because the shirt is new and has not been work or washed, but I might return it because of it.  As far as cut, I would say the body of this shirt is about a modern cut, so in between a traditional cut and a slim cut.  The shoulders, arms, and upper chest area are traditional in fit.  The jury is out on this as to if I want to take the risk to see if the shoulders round off or stay boxy.",nautica mens short sleeve solid stretch cotton pique polo shirt in bright cobalt  nautica is one of my goto brands because i generally like their materials look and fit  i have not come across the material that this polo is made out of before  the material is a stretch material and it stretches pretty easily with movement in a good way  the material seems decent  its not too thin and i like the stretchiness to it for movement  the color is true to the image  the one issue i am running into is the shoulders are very boxy  where the top shoulder stitching is it steaks straight out left and right so it gives it this very boxy squared off look that is not good  i dont know if it is because the shirt is new and has not been work or washed but i might return it because of it  as far as cut i would say the body of this shirt is about a modern cut so in between a traditional cut and a slim cut  the shoulders arms and upper chest area are traditional in fit  the jury is out on this as to if i want to take the risk to see if the shoulders round off or stay boxy,1

I bought 3 of these shirts in the size tall large.  They fit me perfect at 6'3 and 164 lbs.  Nice colors and quality stitching.  I do agree with others that these are not cotton.  My guess is poly and rayon??  They are comfortable to wear.  I have washed and dried using the permanent press settings on our machines and found them NOT to have shrunk at all.  Also they were basically wrinkle free!  Very satisfied with these shirts.Just added one more to my collection (11-27-24). Just love these shirts.

"I was conflicted between the small and medium size, but I took a chance on the small, even know I normally wear mediums in hoodies and other jackets.I based my size off of a Wrangler work jacket I recieved last year for Christmas that was a size medium. Unfortunately, that jacket was a bit too big, for the sleeves went far past my wrists and the shoulder seams went too far past the end of my shoulder. It felt too bulky as well.So for this Carharrt I took a chance on the size small and didn't regret it. It fit perfect; the shoulder seams lined up and the sleeves covered my wrists perfectly. The length was good as well without it extending too low below my hips. I was even able to wear my favorite hoodie underneath it without the jacket feeling constrained and arm movement still feeling spacious.Keep in mind I have a relatively small frame, anyway so your mileage may vary.I asked my dad to try the jacket on, who is an inch shorter than me and has a more athletic build with slightly bigger shoulders, and it fit him perfect as well.The jacket itself feels high quality and will definitely hold up to some wear and the sherpa will definitely keep you warm. It's now probably the best jacket I've ever owned with plenty of pockets and a lightweight feel to the overall coat.Highly recommend if your considering it, for it is a solid alternative if the Detroit jacket lacks too little features for you.",i was conflicted between the small and medium size but i took a chance on the small even know i normally wear mediums in hoodies and other jacketsi based my size off of a wrangler work jacket i recieved last year for christmas that was a size medium unfortunately that jacket was a bit too big for the sleeves went far past my wrists and the shoulder seams went too far past the end of my shoulder it felt too bulky as wellso for this carharrt i took a chance on the size small and didnt regret it it fit perfect the shoulder seams lined up and the sleeves covered my wrists perfectly the length was good as well without it extending too low below my hips i was even able to wear my favorite hoodie underneath it without the jacket feeling constrained and arm movement still feeling spaciouskeep in mind i have a relatively small frame anyway so your mileage may varyi asked my dad to try the jacket on who is an inch shorter than me and has a more athletic build with slightly bigger shoulders and it fit him perfect as wellthe jacket itself feels high quality and will definitely hold up to some wear and the sherpa will definitely keep you warm its now probably the best jacket ive ever owned with plenty of pockets and a lightweight feel to the overall coathighly recommend if your considering it for it is a solid alternative if the detroit jacket lacks too little features for you,1

"I recently picked up a pair of these shorts, and they have quickly become my favorite go-to shorts for any occasion.

The fabric blend provides just the right amount of stretch, allowing for a comfortable fit without feeling restrictive.

The material is also durable and stands up well to frequent washing without losing its shape or color.The design of the Wrangler Authentics Men's Classic Cargo Stretch Shorts is both functional and stylish. The multiple pockets are a game-changer, offering ample storage space for my essentials. The cargo pockets are spacious and easily hold my phone, wallet, keys, and even a small notebook. The added convenience of having secure places to store my items without needing a bag is fantastic, especially when I'm on the go.The craftsmanship of these shorts is top-notch. The stitching is strong and sturdy, ensuring that the shorts will last for years to come. The zipper and button closures are robust and reliable, adding to the overall quality of the product. The classic cargo style is timeless and versatile, making these shorts easy to pair with a variety of tops and footwear for different looks.One aspect I particularly appreciate is the attention to detail in the design. The waistband is comfortable and sits just right, without digging in or slipping down. The length of the shorts is perfect, hitting just above the knee, which gives a modern yet classic look. The color options are also great, allowing me to choose a shade that fits my personal style.These shorts have exceeded my expectations in every way. They offer a perfect blend of comfort, durability, and functionality, making them an essential addition to any wardrobe.

"Purchased: 04/26/2024- **Material:** 100% Heavyweight Cotton- **Pack Options:** Available in 1 or 2 packs- **Sizes:** Includes regular and tall sizes- **Colors:** Multiple color optionsI just started wearing my new Hanes Beefy T-shirt and felt compelled to share my first impressions about this iconic piece of casual wear. Known for its heavyweight cotton, this tee promises durability and comfort, and so far, it’s living up to the hype.**Initial Thoughts on Quality and Comfort**Right from the start, the quality of the fabric stood out. The cotton is noticeably thick, which I appreciate because it feels like it can withstand the wear and tear of daily life. The comfort level is exactly what you would hope for in a casual tee – soft on the skin with a fit that feels tailored but not tight.**Wearing Experience**- **Thickness and Fabric:** The thickness of the T-shirt is perfect for cooler days without being too bulky, making it a great all-season wear. The fabric is breathable, which is a plus.- **Fit and Shrinkage:** I’ve only washed it once, but so far, there’s been minimal shrinkage, which is often a concern with cotton tees. It fits true to size, and the availability of tall sizes is a bonus for those who need a bit more length.- **Color and Value:** I opted for a classic gray, and the color was true to what was advertised. Considering the quality and feel, the value for money seems very good.**Overall Impressions**The Hanes Beefy T-shirt ticks all the boxes for a reliable, everyday T-shirt. It’s sturdy yet comfortable, and the fit is just right—neither too loose nor too constrictive. Whether you’re out for a casual meet-up or just lounging at home, this T-shirt serves the purpose well.**Specs Recap:**- **100% Heavyweight Cotton:** Durable and soft.- **Minimal Shrinkage:** Holds its shape and size after washing.- **True to Size Fit:** Comfortably fits without being too tight or too loose.I recommend the Hanes Beefy T-shirt if you’re looking for a high-quality, comfortable, and durable tee.

"I am not exactly what one would call an In Shape human. I'm a big guy, husky, and at age 45 finding a pair of pants that both stays up and doesn't feel like I'm wearing spandex or a parachute is quite the task, let me tell you. And I have tried A LOT of pants on here over the past couple of years.This right here is the clear winner. Hands down. 40-30's fit me like a glove. I've been at work for 10 hours and just now noticed as I was getting close to leaving this morning that I had forgotten to wear my belt. Never noticed at all. Normally I don't go anywhere without it or my super sexy dad bod that is somewhat shaped like a turnip these days would push them to my knees within ten steps. I even wear suspenders sometimes because I detest holding/pulling my pants up we I walk around.The pants themselves are very good quality. Excellent material that seems much more durable than any other pair I have tried on Amazon. They feel like they're double layers of fabric instead of a flimsy single layer. Good quality belt loops and the waistband is stretchy, they feel like they're meant to last. I ordered a pair of similar wranglers at the same time as these bad boys and while the wranglers fit, the quality feels cheap and thin. Considering the wranglers were WAY more expensive, it's a no brainer. Wranglers are going back, these stay and I'm ordering more of them right now. Hopefully they don't jack the price up after my good review lol. If you're looking for some new duds to wrap those sexy dad bod stems of yours in, and you're on the fence about which ones to get, this one is your best bet I assure you. For the love of God don't buy the Amazon essentials one, I've run through 8 pairs of them in the past two months, they're made of paper or something that just rips off belt loops, pockets, and everything else after you wear them to work a few times.",i am not exactly what one would call an in shape human im a big guy husky and at age  finding a pair of pants that both stays up and doesnt feel like im wearing spandex or a parachute is quite the task let me tell you and i have tried a lot of pants on here over the past couple of yearsthis right here is the clear winner hands down s fit me like a glove ive been at work for  hours and just now noticed as i was getting close to leaving this morning that i had forgotten to wear my belt never noticed at all normally i dont go anywhere without it or my super sexy dad bod that is somewhat shaped like a turnip these days would push them to my knees within ten steps i even wear suspenders sometimes because i detest holdingpulling my pants up we i walk aroundthe pants themselves are very good quality excellent material that seems much more durable than any other pair i have tried on amazon they feel like theyre double layers of fabric instead of a flimsy single layer good quality belt loops and the waistband is stretchy they feel like theyre meant to last i ordered a pair of similar wranglers at the same time as these bad boys and while the wranglers fit the quality feels cheap and thin considering the wranglers were way more expensive its a no brainer wranglers are going back these stay and im ordering more of them right now hopefully they dont jack the price up after my good review lol if youre looking for some new duds to wrap those sexy dad bod stems of yours in and youre on the fence about which ones to get this one is your best bet i assure you for the love of god dont buy the amazon essentials one ive run through  pairs of them in the past two months theyre made of paper or something that just rips off belt loops pockets and everything else after you wear them to work a few times,1
"First, for whatever reason, Amazon thought I would want a large. I didn’t listen. I got a medium.The fit in the neck and shoulders and chest is great. As some others have noted, the arms are a bit snug. I’m not built like Popeye but my forearms almost filled this out.The biggest annoyance is that these things were designed for skinny armed giants. If you are 6‘5“ tall with slender arms, don’t hesitate, five stars. You’ll love these.Alas, I’m going to take the lot of them to the tailor and have them remove about 5 inches from the bottom of each. They are too long.I imagine they might charge me five dollars a shirt. These will still be a decent value after that, and they will fit much better.",first for whatever reason amazon thought i would want a large i didn’t listen i got a mediumthe fit in the neck and shoulders and chest is great as some others have noted the arms are a bit snug i’m not built like popeye but my forearms almost filled this outthe biggest annoyance is that these things were designed for skinny armed giants if you are ‘“ tall with slender arms don’t hesitate five stars you’ll love thesealas i’m going to take the lot of them to the tailor and have them remove about  inches from the bottom of each they are too longi imagine they might charge me five dollars a shirt these will still be a decent value after that and they will fit much better,1

"This is the best jacket I have ever owned. It is really warm even in the coldest weather.  Very well made and tough. The only thing that some people might say about it is its a little heavy but it’s well worth it considering how good of a jacket it is.

"Thin, inexpensive, but well-cut men's undershirts. They don't have the technical fabric or closer fit of the Under Armour or Calvin Klein.. But the price is much lower per shirt, and the insubstantial, non-clingy fabric is light enough to forget you're wearing that layer.I was looking for new, basic black shirts after my usual suppliers had grown unreliable-- something that would look good under a button-down shirt or sweater, wouldn't add bulk, wasn't super expensive, was long enough to tuck but not too long  so I could still wear it out, and wouldn't look bad if worn by itself.  I also tried the Calvin Klein Men's Undershirts Cotton Stretch and the Under Armour Men's Cotton Stretch Crew Undershirt:* This Amazon Essentials is the most under-shirt of the bunch. The thin fabric doesn't hide much. The sleeves are loose rather than fitted, and slightly longer than the other two. The L doesn't cling on the shoulders or back. It feels like a thin version of a normal tee-shirt cut. The sleeves are a bit bulky under another shirt.* The CK is a stretch fabric (which usually wears better over time than plain cotton), but not too fitted. The material is thick enough to wear comfortably as a tee. It has a really nice roll collar (a folded/stitched collar rather than a flat one-- rolled ones don't get messed up as quickly by repeated wash/wear cycles). There's a white CK tag on the hem that stands out a bit too much if you wear it untucked. The CK is the most expensive of the three.* The UA is the most fitted of the bunch, with the shortest sleeves-- it'll be easiest to wear comfortably under another tight layer. The stretchy material is good quality and like the CK could be worn by itself, although its clinginess requires a reasonably athletic build in that case.I tried size L in all cases. All three brands break at the right spot (hip) to be tuckable for most heights. I like the Amazon Essentials the least of the bunch since I don't like to fiddle to get my under sleeves to sit right, but it's going to be the most familiar fit for people who regularly wear undershirts. It's also the cheapest.Like Amazon's other house brands, Essentials is a good choice for can't decide between brands, providing value without having to spend too much time comparison shopping.This shirt is a little too under-shirty for the wear by itself category, but otherwise works well.

"Just got this coat today, so haven't had a chance to really wear it. Just wore it once outside for a short time, so can't speak to the warmth level yet. Will update. All the pockets are nice.But the one thing I have to mention is that it fits pretty snug. I got the 3XL Big size. I'm 6'3 , 270 pounds. I thought it would fit better. The length is good. But the sleeves are a bit tight and pull back when I stretch out my arms. The chest area and shoulders feel a bit tight as well when I zip it. I'm not sure if I'll be able to wear it comfortably to work with a hoodie underneath. I'll try it and see how it is, but it's not looking promising.I will say the material is pretty nice, and for the price it's definitely a nice coat. I really want to love it and keep it, but don't know if the size will work. Unfortunately it's the biggest they have. I think the word big after the 3XL is a bit misleading to be honest. I have other regular 3XL coats that fit much better, just can't wear them for work.I'll update on the warmth. Hopefully I don't have to return it for the tightness.It's overall worth the money for sure if it fits well.",just got this coat today so havent had a chance to really wear it just wore it once outside for a short time so cant speak to the warmth level yet will update all the pockets are nicebut the one thing i have to mention is that it fits pretty snug i got the xl big size im    pounds i thought it would fit better the length is good but the sleeves are a bit tight and pull back when i stretch out my arms the chest area and shoulders feel a bit tight as well when i zip it im not sure if ill be able to wear it comfortably to work with a hoodie underneath ill try it and see how it is but its not looking promisingi will say the material is pretty nice and for the price its definitely a nice coat i really want to love it and keep it but dont know if the size will work unfortunately its the biggest they have i think the word big after the xl is a bit misleading to be honest i have other regular xl coats that fit much better just cant wear them for workill update on the warmth hopefully i dont have to return it for the tightnessits overall worth the money for sure if it fits well,1

"I'm not a very tall guy at 5 ft 8, but I'm a bit on the heavy side.  I normally get XL, and some Large shirts.  I'm just short and big framed, its kind of hard to explain I guess.  People see me and think I weigh a certain amount, then I tell them how much I weigh, and they are like what?Either way back to the shirt.  I saw it was on sale for cyber Monday, I needed some shirts, so I got one from them and a few other vendors/sellers.  The shirt looks great, feels good, but just doesn't fit right.  I got the XL based off some of the reviews I read, thinking that would have been fine, again I wear Large and XL from other companies no issues.  It was just a bit snug, and wasn't much for me to tuck in if I wanted to tuck them into my pants.  If I had a redo I'd have got the 2xl, or maybe its time I need to lose weight.All in all, the shirt is great, just I got the wrong size, the down side to shopping online for clothes haha!",im not a very tall guy at  ft  but im a bit on the heavy side  i normally get xl and some large shirts  im just short and big framed its kind of hard to explain i guess  people see me and think i weigh a certain amount then i tell them how much i weigh and they are like whateither way back to the shirt  i saw it was on sale for cyber monday i needed some shirts so i got one from them and a few other vendorssellers  the shirt looks great feels good but just doesnt fit right  i got the xl based off some of the reviews i read thinking that would have been fine again i wear large and xl from other companies no issues  it was just a bit snug and wasnt much for me to tuck in if i wanted to tuck them into my pants  if i had a redo id have got the xl or maybe its time i need to lose weightall in all the shirt is great just i got the wrong size the down side to shopping online for clothes haha,1
"These Polos are a bit light for my taste—preferring heavier weight materials that wick moisture away from the body during hot & humid days—but they are nicely designed and well crafted. As a professional pilot, I find that a shoulder pocket for pen & pencil comes in handy, but I’m inclined to think this shirt’s pockets may be too short for many writing instruments.The Polo are cut somewhat small. I invariably wear Medium shirts, but found this brand a little smaller than expected; fitting more like a body shirt.

"I was a bit skeptical to get these because of the mixed reviews, but I'm glad I did. The black is a true dark black and the material is incredibly forgiving. They are surprisingly long on me, but I prefer that. They are advertised as mid-waisted straight leg jeans, but they look like high-waisted wide leg jeans with a slight flare/bootcut on me. Based on other reviews, I think the jean style depends heavily on your body type.I'm 5'6, ~180 lbs, and typically a 10/12 in most brands. According to the size chart, I am a 14 so I ordered that. Perfect fit, albeit a bit long. The button and zipper are definitely on the flimsier/cheaper side, but we'll see how they hold up. No crazy smell when I opened them; they smelled like regular new factory fresh clothing (if that makes any sense).",i was a bit skeptical to get these because of the mixed reviews but im glad i did the black is a true dark black and the material is incredibly forgiving they are surprisingly long on me but i prefer that they are advertised as midwaisted straight leg jeans but they look like highwaisted wide leg jeans with a slight flarebootcut on me based on other reviews i think the jean style depends heavily on your body typeim   lbs and typically a  in most brands according to the size chart i am a  so i ordered that perfect fit albeit a bit long the button and zipper are definitely on the flimsiercheaper side but well see how they hold up no crazy smell when i opened them they smelled like regular new factory fresh clothing if that makes any sense,1
"While these are labeled as workout shirts I think perhaps they are a bit dressy for that, in fact they are quite a bit dressier than my usual pick of all cotton tee shirt, the brand that has tens of thousands of reviews here. These aren’t quite as popular but they should be, they are better made and about the same price per shirt if you buy the multipacks with five shirts in them. And the biggest thing they have going for them is the incredible choice of colors, although I would suggest to them that they should try to stay away from including so many of the dull dark colors, today’s active man doesn’t dress like his grandfather, bright colors are very popular now.The material isn’t like most casual tee shirts, it is a shiny slick manmade material that on close inspection looks like it is knit like a very thin sweater.WHAT I LIKETopping the list of likes are the great bright colors that stay bright wash after wash. They don’t shrink either and they are true to U.S. men’s sizes.  That makes them easy to buy.  They feel great and don’t show wrinkles.NOT SO POSITIVEThere is nothing that I dislike about these but there are a few things you should know. One is that they are fairly thin. That coupled with the shiny texture makes them reveal everything including the nips. They also look too expensive and dressy to wear casually around the house, like mowing the lawn for example. Like I said, not a negative just something to be aware of. If you live in a hot climate as I do these are absolutely wonderfully cool and lightweight feeling.YES OR NOAfter getting ready to order my usual brand and being disappointed that their shades are so boring I searched and was amazed how many choices there were. I landed on these because of the huge range of colors available. Once I saw the price (especially for the multi-paks) I was hooked.

I received many compliments on the pants for our 90s themed day at work (jokes on them because I will be wearing these on a weekly basis now haha)!With that being said, I love these pants so much, and after reviewing the reviews, I would not chance drying these pants on high heat (as they are 97% cotton!).

"The quality of the jacket is extraordinarily good for the price that it is sold for. It is really comfy and stylish as I wear it to work everyday now.

"Super nice jacket.  For me, it's very warm, and yet keeps you cool as well.  I'm always cold, and generally wear a hooded sweatshirt under my jacket.  With this one, I've not needed one.  We'll see when we get some sub-freezing temperatures again, as I'm in California, and the lows have been mostly mid to higher 30s lately in my area.  I'm pretty sure it will be fine as the bottom stays snug against you, keeping the drafts out.  The sleeves do as well, and I love that the canvas extends below the cuff, hiding it.  The hood is nice and large, drawstring will tighten it to the point it looks like a ski mask, and when zipped up fully, the neckline is nice and snug.  Ample pocket space, but can't use the outer pockets for a cellphone without it standing, risking it falling out.  Inside pockets are zippered on the left and velcro patch in middle of right.  Left can close with my s24+ inside, but in right pocket, it fits, but blocks the velcro.  Small details in my opinion, but may matter to some.  As for the zipper, it's metal(looks like brass), and feels like it's robust enough that it will last the life of the jacket.  Overall, excellent quality as always.",super nice jacket  for me its very warm and yet keeps you cool as well  im always cold and generally wear a hooded sweatshirt under my jacket  with this one ive not needed one  well see when we get some subfreezing temperatures again as im in california and the lows have been mostly mid to higher s lately in my area  im pretty sure it will be fine as the bottom stays snug against you keeping the drafts out  the sleeves do as well and i love that the canvas extends below the cuff hiding it  the hood is nice and large drawstring will tighten it to the point it looks like a ski mask and when zipped up fully the neckline is nice and snug  ample pocket space but cant use the outer pockets for a cellphone without it standing risking it falling out  inside pockets are zippered on the left and velcro patch in middle of right  left can close with my s inside but in right pocket it fits but blocks the velcro  small details in my opinion but may matter to some  as for the zipper its metallooks like brass and feels like its robust enough that it will last the life of the jacket  overall excellent quality as always,1

"Oh my goodness, these pants remind me of my dad.  I'm retired but clearly remember my father wearing similar pants.  I'm judging these pants against the ones my dad wore, which (I'm sure) were 100% wool.  These are a polyester blend, so they don't have quite the same quality look and it is unlikely that they will hold up as well as his, which he seemed to wear for many years.  However, the style is similar.  Also, these are reasonably priced.In my mind they look very retro and masculine.  However, I showed them to my daughter, who thought they looked more feminine.  Why?  A fashion trend in women's pants is the front pleat that was the hallmark of men's pants in the 50s and 60s!  Funny how fashion trends work.  Anyway, I like these pants.

"The Levi's Men's 559 Relaxed Straight Jeans have been a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. Given that I don't usually spend much on clothes, these jeans have really impressed me with their durability and comfort.

Despite frequent use and washing, the fabric remains sturdy and the color stays true. The relaxed straight cut provides a comfortable fit that allows for easy movement, making them ideal for various activities.The only minor downside is that the sizing can be slightly inconsistent between different pairs, so it's worth trying on a few to find the best fit.For anyone seeking reliable and comfortable jeans that won't break the bank, the Levi's 559s are an excellent choice.

These seem relatively well made and comfortable for a casual shoe. Only fault I have found so far is that the laces seem a few inches too short.  Have to be cautious when tying the bow knot to not pull end of the lace through the knot.  Can't comment on durability and longevity yet as only wear them for casual outings so don't have a lot of miles on them yet.,these seem relatively well made and comfortable for a casual shoe only fault i have found so far is that the laces seem a few inches too short  have to be cautious when tying the bow knot to not pull end of the lace through the knot  cant comment on durability and longevity yet as only wear them for casual outings so dont have a lot of miles on them yet,1
"UPDATE 9/2023: I finally had to wash these, and was sad to find that they do shrink in the wash. So the 30 inch length that was perfect for me before washing is now too short. They're also less soft now that I've washed them. I will order a new pair in the 32 length and try to get the length tailored since they aren't offered in a 31 inch length.Seriously, finding jeans like these is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. It's virtually impossible, so it feels almost miraculous when it does happen.I have decently large thighs (from cycling and other things), and calves, and a decent size rear. Most men's jeans are too straight, so they're too tight across the thighs (showing pocket lines and underwear lines), or too saggy in the butt, or the legs are just plain too tight, or they're too baggy and look messy.I'm a tall, muscular guy with a decently athletic build. I don't claim to be a model or anything, but pants shouldn't look as sloppy on me as they tend to. I shouldn't have to pick between pants that fit like skinny jeans and pants that make me look like I have absolutely no sense of fashion (i.e. the infamous baggy, shapeless, dad jean fit). I see tall, muscular guys in movies and tv shows that have great fitting jeans that complement their muscular builds without looking like skinny jeans, and I think to myself people love this look, so why can't I find that pants that fit like that?It turns out, pants like that do exist. These Levi's 541 Athletic Fit pants in the Native Cali color fit, feel, and look amazing. They're beautifully manly pants, without being too cowboy or too hip. They're very neutral, allow you to wear them with leather dress shoes, boots, or sneakers, without looking too weird.The fit around the hips/but is great, with enough room for them to sit where you want them to (not low-cut skinny jeans or saggy hipster jeans), so you shouldn't have issues with plumber's crack, as long as you get the right fit and wear a belt.The fit around the thighs is also great. Depending on what size you order, they have enough room that they don't show pocket lines or underwear lines, and unlike many pants, they're actually cut in such a way that if the pants fit well at the waist, the thighs aren't too tight. These come in 1 inch sizes, you can experiment to find the right fit for you. I find that both the 36 and the 35 waist fit me well. The 35 I do fold up the pockets to avoid pocket lines, and that size gives me more of a custom-made for me look. The 36 has a little more room, so the lines aren't an issue so far, but they aren't quite so fitted, but they also aren't straying into dad-jean territory.I also love that even though they have extra room in the seat and thighs, they aren't too tight in the calves, OR too wide and shapeless at the ankle. As I mentioned, my legs are different widths at the thigh, knees, calves, AND ankles, so finding jeans that fit ok in all places is incredible. The fit being right at the ankles makes for a nice modern look that can work with a variety of footwear. If the ankles were wider, they would splay out at the show and give more a bootcut or dad-jean look that doesn't look good with sneakers or other snappy fits.The one downside is that the length varies. I had to buy two pairs of the same length to find one that fit right. The other pair was slightly too short.I haven't washed these yet, and I'm reluctant to do so until I really have to. It's possible that doing so will change my rating. But right now, they fit perfectly, and the color is so black that I can wear these with a formal black vest and a button down and it looks great. I'm sure the dye will fade over time the more I wear these, and then they'll become more casual-wear jeans. But for now I love these just the way they are.",update  i finally had to wash these and was sad to find that they do shrink in the wash so the  inch length that was perfect for me before washing is now too short theyre also less soft now that ive washed them i will order a new pair in the  length and try to get the length tailored since they arent offered in a  inch lengthseriously finding jeans like these is like finding the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow its virtually impossible so it feels almost miraculous when it does happeni have decently large thighs from cycling and other things and calves and a decent size rear most mens jeans are too straight so theyre too tight across the thighs showing pocket lines and underwear lines or too saggy in the butt or the legs are just plain too tight or theyre too baggy and look messyim a tall muscular guy with a decently athletic build i dont claim to be a model or anything but pants shouldnt look as sloppy on me as they tend to i shouldnt have to pick between pants that fit like skinny jeans and pants that make me look like i have absolutely no sense of fashion ie the infamous baggy shapeless dad jean fit i see tall muscular guys in movies and tv shows that have great fitting jeans that complement their muscular builds without looking like skinny jeans and i think to myself people love this look so why cant i find that pants that fit like thatit turns out pants like that do exist these levis  athletic fit pants in the native cali color fit feel and look amazing theyre beautifully manly pants without being too cowboy or too hip theyre very neutral allow you to wear them with leather dress shoes boots or sneakers without looking too weirdthe fit around the hipsbut is great with enough room for them to sit where you want them to not lowcut skinny jeans or saggy hipster jeans so you shouldnt have issues with plumbers crack as long as you get the right fit and wear a beltthe fit around the thighs is also great depending on what size you order they have enough room that they dont show pocket lines or underwear lines and unlike many pants theyre actually cut in such a way that if the pants fit well at the waist the thighs arent too tight these come in  inch sizes you can experiment to find the right fit for you i find that both the  and the  waist fit me well the  i do fold up the pockets to avoid pocket lines and that size gives me more of a custommade for me look the  has a little more room so the lines arent an issue so far but they arent quite so fitted but they also arent straying into dadjean territoryi also love that even though they have extra room in the seat and thighs they arent too tight in the calves or too wide and shapeless at the ankle as i mentioned my legs are different widths at the thigh knees calves and ankles so finding jeans that fit ok in all places is incredible the fit being right at the ankles makes for a nice modern look that can work with a variety of footwear if the ankles were wider they would splay out at the show and give more a bootcut or dadjean look that doesnt look good with sneakers or other snappy fitsthe one downside is that the length varies i had to buy two pairs of the same length to find one that fit right the other pair was slightly too shorti havent washed these yet and im reluctant to do so until i really have to its possible that doing so will change my rating but right now they fit perfectly and the color is so black that i can wear these with a formal black vest and a button down and it looks great im sure the dye will fade over time the more i wear these and then theyll become more casualwear jeans but for now i love these just the way they are,1

"I have yet to wear these out, but from initial trials they seem comfortable and have plenty of toe room, and even though not a wide size, they accommodate my orthotic and don't bind in areas where I'm developing age-related foot issues.  They are more stylish than a normal athletic shoe while having the comfort of one. A couple drawbacks I'll learn to live with: This style, in a longer size, really exaggerates how long they look on the foot. It would help if they had some vertical details/stitching along the upper part to break that long plane from laces to toe. I am a woman who must often go to men's shoes to get the length I need, and while many styles are interchangeable with a woman's version; this one, because of that long stretch of uninterrupted fabric does make me self-conscious about how big my foot looks. The other issue for me is the bright white sole. It is difficult to find a comfortable shoe with a coordinating sole color. The white looks OK on this and keeps them from becoming too oxford-like, but I fear the white will soon be stained by the elements. I bought these to look a little more dressy with dress slacks, and since I can no longer wear leather uppers, these will be fine, and the length should seem less dramatic once there's a pant's cuff. breaking up the total length.

"I recently purchased the PRETTYGARDEN Women's Plain Round Neck Cute Ruffle Short Sleeve Top, and I absolutely love it! The top is exactly as described—cute, stylish, and perfect for everyday wear. The round neck design is flattering, and the ruffle sleeves add a lovely feminine touch without being overwhelming. The fabric is soft and comfortable against the skin, making it ideal for both casual outings and lounging at home. I appreciate the simplicity of the plain color, which makes it easy to pair with different bottoms and accessories. The fit is true to size, providing a relaxed yet flattering silhouette. It's easy to care for and has held up well after washing. Overall, this top has become a favorite in my wardrobe for its comfort, style, and versatility.

"Men's collared shirts for $7 a piece. I had low expectations, but I figured if they did not work out, I could return them. I am 5'10, a little overweight at around 250 lbs and ordered 2XL.

"I couldn't be more pleased with my purchase of the Nike Men's Gymnastics Shoes Slipper. As someone who works tirelessly at a no-kill animal shelter, I cover anywhere from 7 to 10 miles on my feet each day. These shoes have been an absolute game-changer for me.First and foremost, the comfort level is outstanding. I used to experience foot fatigue and discomfort after long hours of walking and standing, but these slipper-like shoes have made all the difference. They provide ample cushioning and support, allowing me to keep going without the constant ache and soreness I used to feel.Not only are they comfortable, but they're also incredibly lightweight, which makes my daily tasks at the shelter even more manageable. I no longer feel weighed down by heavy footwear, and that's a significant relief.The durability of these shoes is also commendable. Given the rigorous demands of my job, I was concerned about wear and tear, but they've held up remarkably well. I can confidently say that they are up to the challenge of my daily routine.In summary, the Nike Men's Gymnastics Shoes Slipper has been a true lifesaver for my feet. I'm no longer plagued by discomfort and fatigue, allowing me to focus on my important work at the animal shelter. I highly recommend these shoes to anyone who needs both comfort and durability in their footwear.",i couldnt be more pleased with my purchase of the nike mens gymnastics shoes slipper as someone who works tirelessly at a nokill animal shelter i cover anywhere from  to  miles on my feet each day these shoes have been an absolute gamechanger for mefirst and foremost the comfort level is outstanding i used to experience foot fatigue and discomfort after long hours of walking and standing but these slipperlike shoes have made all the difference they provide ample cushioning and support allowing me to keep going without the constant ache and soreness i used to feelnot only are they comfortable but theyre also incredibly lightweight which makes my daily tasks at the shelter even more manageable i no longer feel weighed down by heavy footwear and thats a significant reliefthe durability of these shoes is also commendable given the rigorous demands of my job i was concerned about wear and tear but theyve held up remarkably well i can confidently say that they are up to the challenge of my daily routinein summary the nike mens gymnastics shoes slipper has been a true lifesaver for my feet im no longer plagued by discomfort and fatigue allowing me to focus on my important work at the animal shelter i highly recommend these shoes to anyone who needs both comfort and durability in their footwear,1
These are very thin so only get these for summer use only. I had bought others for year around and was shocked at how light these are so I kept them just for summer use. I'm old so I will never wear these out but if I was young and was very active in the garage these probably wouldn't last long. They do pick up pet hair and being black will show the world but I love my dog enough that it doesn't matter much to me.

"Amazon suggested I order the Medium size.  (I am 5'8 and 165 pounds, and I wear a medium in most things.)  It was too long in the arms, waist, and too big around the barrel.  This style looks better as a slim fit, and it's quite stylish.  Appropriate as a jacket for nice restaurants and such.  I've been wanting a skewed-formal black jacket for years now, as my partner has one, but I simply couldn't find one that didn't have a weird zipper on the chest, downgrading the formality.

Great quality - this is a medium weight coat. Perfect as a car coat but too thin for cold winter days if you had to be outside for long periods of time. The fit is just perfect. Purchased a size large for a man 5’6 175 lbs with a small belly so peacoat double breasted look - looks great! Lining is standard and the grey color is very appealing. This is soft feeling coat made to look like wool without the heavy rougher wool feel. Only issue is that the coat comes packaged in a small bag and so when you open it the coat it totally wrinkled. You can knock out the wrinkles in the dryer with a wrinkle release dryer sheet or use a garment steamer but honestly the dryer trick is the key.,great quality  this is a medium weight coat perfect as a car coat but too thin for cold winter days if you had to be outside for long periods of time the fit is just perfect purchased a size large for a man ’  lbs with a small belly so peacoat double breasted look  looks great lining is standard and the grey color is very appealing this is soft feeling coat made to look like wool without the heavy rougher wool feel only issue is that the coat comes packaged in a small bag and so when you open it the coat it totally wrinkled you can knock out the wrinkles in the dryer with a wrinkle release dryer sheet or use a garment steamer but honestly the dryer trick is the key,1

"Edit to add: These do have horrible traction in wet/snow.  Use extreme caution on wet floors, and just don't wear if it's snowy/icy.  I'm removing 1 star for that, because I had to get a different pair of shoes for bad weather.  (Telluride Moc, which are better for traction, but not as comfortable.)  That said, I'm on my 3rd pair of these, and for regular office work, they're great.Original:Why did I not buy these sooner?TL;DR: Great shoes.  Fit big feet.  Comfortable.  Don't feel like clogs/slippers.I am someone who values my time and..... oh hell... I'm lazy.  I slip my shoes off by holding down the heel with the other foot, and put them on before leaving for work by sticking my foot back in.  As such, I tend to destroy the heels of all my shoes.(I'm a computer tech, so I mostly wear sneakers or ""casual"" shoes)For years I'd thought about getting these sort of shoes, and for years I'd held off because I have huge feet (15) and usually only new balance fit my foot correctly without a break-in period.I can now say there's an exception to that rule.  I got the 14s of these the first time around, because people said they ran big.  Not so.  14 was too small, so I went to 15, and they're perfect.  They also have arch support that at first felt weird, but now feels like something I don't know how I lived without.  They have also felt like a broken-in pair since the first (maybe second) day I wore them.If I have any complaint, it's that they pick up a TON of sand/salt/ice/snow in the tread and keep dropping it for a good half hour once you get to your destination in winter.  At home I take off my shoes at the door, but I notice it at work when my chair is crunching over sand from the parking lot.Most importantly, however, I've been wearing these for a couple weeks now, all day, every day, and they still slip on and off with ease, but don't feel floppy on my feet when I'm walking over weird terrain.  If I had any wish, I guess it'd be that they make a pair with mesh in the toe area.  They do get a little warm at times, but I don't see an easy way to do that with the design.Overall.... well, I guess the fact that I'm planning to buy a second pair speaks for itself.",edit to add these do have horrible traction in wetsnow  use extreme caution on wet floors and just dont wear if its snowyicy  im removing  star for that because i had to get a different pair of shoes for bad weather  telluride moc which are better for traction but not as comfortable  that said im on my rd pair of these and for regular office work theyre greatoriginalwhy did i not buy these soonertldr great shoes  fit big feet  comfortable  dont feel like clogsslippersi am someone who values my time and oh hell im lazy  i slip my shoes off by holding down the heel with the other foot and put them on before leaving for work by sticking my foot back in  as such i tend to destroy the heels of all my shoesim a computer tech so i mostly wear sneakers or casual shoesfor years id thought about getting these sort of shoes and for years id held off because i have huge feet  and usually only new balance fit my foot correctly without a breakin periodi can now say theres an exception to that rule  i got the s of these the first time around because people said they ran big  not so   was too small so i went to  and theyre perfect  they also have arch support that at first felt weird but now feels like something i dont know how i lived without  they have also felt like a brokenin pair since the first maybe second day i wore themif i have any complaint its that they pick up a ton of sandsalticesnow in the tread and keep dropping it for a good half hour once you get to your destination in winter  at home i take off my shoes at the door but i notice it at work when my chair is crunching over sand from the parking lotmost importantly however ive been wearing these for a couple weeks now all day every day and they still slip on and off with ease but dont feel floppy on my feet when im walking over weird terrain  if i had any wish i guess itd be that they make a pair with mesh in the toe area  they do get a little warm at times but i dont see an easy way to do that with the designoverall well i guess the fact that im planning to buy a second pair speaks for itself,1

"A brand that's been around forever because of its consistent quality, fit and durability. My husband is 78 years old.

Not to be too graphic, but sometimes I throw the underwear away rather than wash them. Also, I like for him to have 2-3 weeks of daily clean briefs because things happen, and I don't always get his laundry done on schedule. I absolutely can't stand dingy and frayed underwear.

"Let’s be real, finding the perfect pair of underwear is like finding a unicorn – it doesn’t happen every day. But Gildan Men’s Underwear Covered Waistband Boxer Briefs? Oh, they’re basically the unicorns of the underwear world. These bad boys fit like a glove, stay put, and make you feel like you’ve just discovered a hidden level of comfort.Pros: • Comfortable Fit: These boxer briefs hug you in all the right places. The soft, breathable fabric makes you feel like you’re wearing nothing at all, except, y’know, you are wearing something, and it’s perfect. No wedgies or uncomfortable bunching, just smooth sailing all day long. • Covered Waistband: The waistband feels like it’s been made for royalty. It’s covered in a soft fabric, so you won’t be feeling like you’re wearing an elastic band that’s constantly trying to cut off circulation. It’s like a cozy hug for your waist, without the awkward side hug vibes. • Multipack = Win: You’re getting multiple pairs of boxer briefs, which means you’re set for a while. No more laundry-day panic when you’re down to your last pair. Plus, the price is so reasonable, you’ll feel like you’re stealing them (but don’t, because that’s not cool). • Durable: These boxer briefs aren’t just comfortable; they’re built to last. Whether you’re throwing them in the laundry after a gym session or lounging on the couch all day (hey, we’ve all been there), they hold up and keep their shape. No sagging or stretching after a few washes, these briefs stick around for the long haul.Cons: • Basic Design: While they’re perfect in functionality, the design isn’t anything flashy. If you’re looking for some fun prints or neon colors to show off, you’ll have to look elsewhere. These are the dependable, no-nonsense kind of underwear, kind of like that reliable friend who brings the chips to the party, not the dip. • May Feel a Little Tight Initially: These are snug, which is great, but if you’re used to a looser fit, you might need a day or two to adjust. But don’t worry, once you break them in, they’ll feel like they’ve been custom-made for you.In conclusion, Gildan Men’s Underwear Covered Waistband Boxer Briefs are the everyday heroes of your underwear drawer. No frills, no fuss, just pure comfort and reliability. They’re the dependable, quiet champions of your daily routine, making sure you’re comfortable from morning to night.

"Fit was slightly large for me. Wash and dry a few times has not shrunk it or faded. I’ve owned for over a year now.

Also, a weird crease pops up after each wash in an odd spot, maybe end of material roll? I don’t wear it as much cause I don’t feel like ironing. Overall, shirt is ok.

These replaced his fleece ones because he needed something lighter for Spring.  Yet they are not too thin and you can not see through them!  Great choice!,bought several of these pants for my elderly husband who was ready to give up jeans  they are easy on and easy off  we also found out that they were water resistance which is great for spills  these replaced his fleece ones because he needed something lighter for spring  yet they are not too thin and you can not see through them  great choice,1
"It was a pleasant surprise when I pulled these out of their bag. Five different colors, each one of them very nice, pleasant for the eyes. The fabric feels very good on the skin (actually pretty soft) and to me it is just about the right thickness. The stitches are all properly done as far as I can see. The shirts fit as expected, in my case it's size XL. I wouldn't necessarily call this shirt tactical just because they are quick dry, have this small loop for sun-/glasses on the chest and a small pocket on one of sleeves. Don't get me wrong, I think these are small details which are welcome by most folks, including me. Finally, $10 per shirt is a very good value, very good. They are definitely worth the price.",it was a pleasant surprise when i pulled these out of their bag five different colors each one of them very nice pleasant for the eyes the fabric feels very good on the skin actually pretty soft and to me it is just about the right thickness the stitches are all properly done as far as i can see the shirts fit as expected in my case its size xl i wouldnt necessarily call this shirt tactical just because they are quick dry have this small loop for sunglasses on the chest and a small pocket on one of sleeves dont get me wrong i think these are small details which are welcome by most folks including me finally  per shirt is a very good value very good they are definitely worth the price,1

"Looks like these reviews get piled under one item, and I can't figure out how to separate them. Anyway, I tried 2 kinds, and I'll post a review for each below.Long Leg Breathable (2XL):This was on the small end of the size range I shoot for, but unlike the competitor I usually use (ExOfficio), these run a bit smaller and stretch less. Couldn't hardly get them on. Now, I suppose it may be because they're not big & tall, but neither are ExOfficio and I've had good luck with them. Can't really give a review of them other than to say that the quality looks good, and if they fit, I would expect them to hold up well. They're soft and material feels as if it would be comfortable. Unfortunately, I've just wasted some money. At least it wasn't ExOfficio money, though. Those are far more expensive.Also, one pair came in a bright teal color. Doesn't bother me, but just beware, in case it would bother you.Big Man Boxer Briefs (2X):These fit better, overall, but offered little support up front, so there is still ample opportunity for a sweaty situation down there. They're thicker, and use way more cotton, so they're probably better at wicking moisture, I just wish they were more supportive. Also, they tend to ride up in the inner thigh a bit, and I think that opens the door for chafing. I just want something in between these two options. Bigger so that they fit around my waist and thighs, breathable, with long legs, and supportive. I'd prefer a blend with more natural fiber like cotton, but until I find one, I'll stick to my ExOfficio 9 boxer briefs. Their 2XLs stretch enough to fit me everywhere and they're super supportive.",looks like these reviews get piled under one item and i cant figure out how to separate them anyway i tried  kinds and ill post a review for each belowlong leg breathable xlthis was on the small end of the size range i shoot for but unlike the competitor i usually use exofficio these run a bit smaller and stretch less couldnt hardly get them on now i suppose it may be because theyre not big  tall but neither are exofficio and ive had good luck with them cant really give a review of them other than to say that the quality looks good and if they fit i would expect them to hold up well theyre soft and material feels as if it would be comfortable unfortunately ive just wasted some money at least it wasnt exofficio money though those are far more expensivealso one pair came in a bright teal color doesnt bother me but just beware in case it would bother youbig man boxer briefs xthese fit better overall but offered little support up front so there is still ample opportunity for a sweaty situation down there theyre thicker and use way more cotton so theyre probably better at wicking moisture i just wish they were more supportive also they tend to ride up in the inner thigh a bit and i think that opens the door for chafing i just want something in between these two options bigger so that they fit around my waist and thighs breathable with long legs and supportive id prefer a blend with more natural fiber like cotton but until i find one ill stick to my exofficio  boxer briefs their xls stretch enough to fit me everywhere and theyre super supportive,1

"Me: 5'9, 230 lbs. Bought XXL, black. Fit as expected. Reasonably light in weight, not bulky. Could layer a hoodie under the jacket if desired. Arm length good for my 35 arms. Cuffs on sleeves for warmth. Hood: substantial, fleece lined, but no drawstring to tighten in the wind. No drawstring to tighten at the jacket's base either, which was just below my beltline, though little room for cold air to blow up & in given my 40 waist. Two medium sized lined outside diagonal pockets with easy-to-operate YKK zippers. One inside left lined breast pocket that was vertical in orientation with a 2cm Velcro strip closure - I'd have preferred a horizontal orientation so nothing drops out if the Velcro fails. Front closure also used same size YKK zipper as pockets. A flap with 5 snaps could be closed over the zipper for additional warmth. I like how the front zipper rises 2-3 up the neck like a scarf for additional warmth. Fabric sheds water effectively. Entire jacket is polyester/ polyester fiberfill. Machine wash cold, dark colors, delicate cycle - dry on low setting. NO dry cleaning. I have been pleased with my ability to move freely in the coat. I'm comfortable at 30*F, even when the wind chill is in the low 20's. Have not laundered yet - I'm hoping the fiberfill does not shift where I lose any insulating properties.

"I like everything about these t-shirts, especially the fact they are so affordable! Where else in the world can you buy better-than-average t-shirts for around $5 each in multipacks? And I'm not talking about cheaply made polyester- these are 100% cotton.Are these undershirts? I don't think of them as undershirt cuz they're much thicker than the thin white ones my wife used to buy for me to wear under my dress shirts. Yet, I suppose one could wear one under a nice flannel shirt to add an extra layer in cold weather.Are they soft/comfortable? Absolutely! They're 100% cotton, designed and cut to fit the typical American Male who wants to show off his biceps. And if you happen to be a plumber, these are long enough to cover that Crack, but not too long, if you know what I mean.How's the size, and do they shrink? Absolutely they shrink but they come literally oversized so I'd  recommend that you order your normal size and then wash them before wearing. As long as you don't use hot water to wash and you set your dryer for casual clothes and permanent press (not sheets and towels) you'll be fine. I ordered an XL in size cuz that's what I always wear, and now after multiple  runs through my washer/dryer they still fit perfectly with no fading so far.How are the colors? Well I ordered black this time, but u purchased several packs in a variety of colors  and not only are they deep , the colors match the photos perfectly!Do they Winkle? Absolutely, have you ever had cotton t-shirts that didn't come out of the dryer, wrinkled? But these are better than most, so if I take a few seconds to lay them flat fresh from the dryer and let them cool, they are good to go!!!Bottom line- you can't go wrong with these! As a guy, I never have too many t-shirts,  cuz there are so many reasons to wear one for work or play, when you have paiting or cleaning to do, if you go to the park or go camping, you need to add an extra layer cuz its cold; or you just need to cover you butt cheaks as you work on your neighbor's disposal!Finally, I've recently gone legally blind so it takes a long time for me to write a decent review, so if this one was helpful please give it a thumbs up.

"Too long and don't want to read.- look discrete- comparable to Kohl's tekwear- comfy- wrinkle free- quick drying- great for travel- may display nipples (read below for the explanation)Firstly, I have been buying these as an alternative to the Kohl's tekwear dry tech which you can get 5 of these for the price of 2-3 at Kohl's when you are using a discount and they are on sale.  In comparison they have a slightly cheaper collar and don't quite last as long but pretty close otherwise they perform the same.The first benefit is for positions like programmers and engineers these are probably acceptable at work if you get the solid colors.The second is that these are excellent for travel, they can roll up around a pair of underwear and get stashed that way in a pair of socks allowing for some serious space saving.  They also DO NOT WRINKLE!They are also designed for working out.  When I didn't have daily lunch meetings I used to frequent a group workout at the gym.  I would wear one of these shirts in the morning and through the work out then exchange it for another shirt.  The one I got sweaty would usually dry during a quick shower and can be put away and the new one dries very quickly if I am in too much of a rush to fully dry off and get back to the office.The comfort is also another thing I love about these.  It is honestly hard to go back to normal shirts on occasions that I need to especially button ups and polos.Now for the few cons I can think of.  The material is conforming if you like to wear snug or are in the wind meaning it will show off your fat or muscles depending on your build in those conditions or your nipples if they are perky so if you or the place you are wearing it to have a problem with any of those things better go with a cotton T-shirt.",too long and dont want to read look discrete comparable to kohls tekwear comfy wrinkle free quick drying great for travel may display nipples read below for the explanationfirstly i have been buying these as an alternative to the kohls tekwear dry tech which you can get  of these for the price of  at kohls when you are using a discount and they are on sale  in comparison they have a slightly cheaper collar and dont quite last as long but pretty close otherwise they perform the samethe first benefit is for positions like programmers and engineers these are probably acceptable at work if you get the solid colorsthe second is that these are excellent for travel they can roll up around a pair of underwear and get stashed that way in a pair of socks allowing for some serious space saving  they also do not wrinklethey are also designed for working out  when i didnt have daily lunch meetings i used to frequent a group workout at the gym  i would wear one of these shirts in the morning and through the work out then exchange it for another shirt  the one i got sweaty would usually dry during a quick shower and can be put away and the new one dries very quickly if i am in too much of a rush to fully dry off and get back to the officethe comfort is also another thing i love about these  it is honestly hard to go back to normal shirts on occasions that i need to especially button ups and polosnow for the few cons i can think of  the material is conforming if you like to wear snug or are in the wind meaning it will show off your fat or muscles depending on your build in those conditions or your nipples if they are perky so if you or the place you are wearing it to have a problem with any of those things better go with a cotton tshirt,1
"I've been wearing Fruit of the Loom boxers for years, but these tag-free woven boxer shorts have quickly become my new favorites! Right out of the package, the first thing I noticed was the quality of the fabric – a soft yet durable blend of 55% cotton and 45% polyester that feels lightweight and breathable against the skin.The relaxed fit is exactly what I look for in boxer shorts, offering plenty of room without being too baggy. They fit true to size, and the elastic waistband is snug without being constrictive, ensuring they stay in place without any adjustments needed throughout the day.One of the standout features for me has been the moisture-wicking capability. Whether it’s during a workout or on a hot day, these boxers keep me dry and comfortable, which is a huge plus.The care instructions are straightforward - machine wash warm on a gentle cycle and tumble dry low. I've washed them several times now and the colors stay vibrant, with no noticeable shrinkage or wear.It’s also worth mentioning that they are tag-free. No more itching or scratching, which adds to the overall comfort of these boxers.In conclusion, if you’re looking for comfortable, durable, and well-made boxer shorts, the Fruit of the Loom tag-free woven boxers are a fantastic choice. They combine functionality with comfort, and at their price point, they represent excellent value for money.

"I probably should not give them as great of a review, as I do not like these out of stock when looking to replace jeans. These are phenomenal for me.

"I wear a 9 when shoes are true to size. A 9.5, ,9w or a 10 when they run small. I ordered these in 9.5 first because of the pointy toe. I knew it.d be narrow. The shoe was the right length. But the toe box was too tight. Then I ordered it in 10 and the shoe was too long. There was about a half inch gap between my heel and the shoe. Then i ordered 9.5w and they are working for me. The shoe part is a bit too wide, but the shoe doesn't fall off my feet. The toe box is snug (expected in pointy shoes) but doesn't hurt my toes. I got them in black and brown also. They are completely flat with no arch support and the shoe insert has some padding but not a lot. I find them comfy but I have completely normal feet. Normal arches, no bunions, no etc. I can wear them if I go for a walk with my granddaughters. Never got blisters from them.

"I bought this for my husband, who normally just wear a fleece Columbia daily, but with the sub-zero temps in NW Indiana this week I wanted him to have an actual coat.  He wore it outside when it was zero degrees on top of his fleece Columbia.  He said that the coat was so warm that he was actually sweating in it!  So I would say it's a good coat.  He liked how soft the interior is as well and the hood is roomy enough that it can partly cover his face when you pull the strings.  He normally wears an XL and we purchased that size.

"I ordered the 2X size.  I'm 6'1'' tall, weigh 260 pounds, and have a bit of a belly (although it's shrinking through diet!).  This jacket fits very well, with plenty of inside space around me.  Not super-loose, but a decent amount of breathing room--literally.I was surprised at the quality for its price, and like the well-placed, zippered pockets.  The Velcro flaps that cover the zippers, including the main one up the front, are well-designed and work well.  I have fairly long arms, and unlike other off-shore clothing I've tried, the sleeve lengths are generous and well-designed to fit a large American frame like mine.I bought the yellow jacket for visibility in the snow and really like the aesthetics.  I looks very good, and dare I say, it's stylish for a jacket of this type.For me, it's an instant yes! and a keeper.  It looks and feels good, and seems like it will last me a long time.

I fixed this by turning them from uncuffed pants to cuffed pants and now they really good.  I think the inseam was off by one inch.Second when you first put them on the buttons are really hard to get though the buttonholes, if you keep your wallet in your back pocket it is hard to open the back pocket.So when the pants arrive put the buttons through the buttonholes a few times before you wear them, this will loosen them up.Overall review:  Not quite as good as a certain company whose initials are L.E., but half the price.",so i bought a pair and the waist size was perfect no issues there nice and roomy pants and the quality appears to be at least as good as other clothes retailers that cost much more these will last many yearstwo things i didnt likefirst the inseam was off too long  i fixed this by turning them from uncuffed pants to cuffed pants and now they really good  i think the inseam was off by one inchsecond when you first put them on the buttons are really hard to get though the buttonholes if you keep your wallet in your back pocket it is hard to open the back pocketso when the pants arrive put the buttons through the buttonholes a few times before you wear them this will loosen them upoverall review  not quite as good as a certain company whose initials are le but half the price,1

"I never know what to expect with clothes I buy online, but this top was a wonderful surprise!  It was shipped in a shrink wrapped package, so I expected wrinkles, but when I took it out of the package and hung it up, the wrinkles were mostly gone within an hour.  It was nice enough to wear to the office without washing or steaming if I wanted to.  The top fits very well -  I got my normal size.  I’m 5’3” and wear a size 12.  I’m self conscious about my belly so I get a size X-LARGE in most tops like this to guarantee a loose fit.  I like that it wasn’t too long since I’m short - it is the perfect length to wear with leggings.  I especially like the fabric.  It’s soft and comfy with no clinging.  It drapes nicely over my body in a flattering way. I love that I can wear a nice looking, business casual like top to work but feel like I’m wearing my favorite old t-shirt!

"Shirts are decent quality, fit well, and are comfortable. But they off-gassed as soon as I opened the package. The off-gassing was worse than a packed foam mattress.

"I really like this style of top., Im a 1X. It flatters and kind of shows off your shoulders. The flat ruching in front is nice. The button closure on the back is pretty; very feminine. It hangs down far enough to cover most of your fanny and tummy so not too short. Looks great with slacks and heels or jeans and sandals.Chiffon I like as its very light. However, there is no stretch. Being no stretch keeps the top looking crisp all day, so I dont mind it not having any give. You can pop it over your head without unbuttoning the back button. Wash on delicate and NO dryer. I put mine in lingerie bags to keep the button from snagging off in the wash. If you take it out of washer to hang and it is wrinkled, you'll have to iron it smooth. So chiffon has its loveliness but one has to use more care than other fabrics. I take it out of washer and immediately hang and smooth flat with my hands and it dries ok that way without an iron; the first time out of its shrink wrap you definitely will have to iron out the creases.I bought about 5 solid colors and 3 patterned. All of the colors and patterns look like their pictures. The only 1 thing that I noticed thats a negative is that a couple of the tops were a little off the others' shaping. Two were a tiny bit shorter or wider than the others.

"I have been buying Lee Extreme Motion jeans since they came on the market, and Lee L342's before that, which this series replaced. These new jeans have maintained the legacy of comfort that the L342's were known for. What sets them apart is their incredible stretch, ensuring a comfortable fit even during the busiest days. These jeans are a godsend if you despise the feeling of being constricted in denim.One caveat, however, is their durability. I'm quite hard on jeans, and these are no exception. Over time, I've noticed some wear and tear, which might be a concern for those who expect their jeans to last a long time. If you're looking for something that can withstand a lot of rugged use, you might want to consider a different option.But for the comfort they provide, I'm willing to overlook the durability issue. These jeans, continuing the tradition of the L342's, are perfect for those days when you need freedom of movement without compromising on style. They come in a variety of styles and washes, making them versatile for various occasions.In summary, having been a loyal customer since the Lee L342's, I can confidently say that these Lee Extreme Motion jeans are a worthy successor, offering exceptional stretch and comfort.

"So, this is designed to be worn as either a jacket or a shirt, allowing you to layer it in and wear it on cold blustery days.I am 6' 1 tall with an athletic build and the large was quite big.  I know it's to allow for a shirt underneath to be worn as a jacket, but it was just too big for me.  I returned it and ordered the medium which gives it a tailored look.I plan to wear it, here in Denver as a cold weather jacket and then as a shirt in the spring and summer.  It's really a great concept and allows for year-round wear (Denver is actually a very temperate climate, but plan accordingly depending on where you live).I got the brown with the plaid inner shell and it looks great.  This is a cotton/polyester blend with approximately 65/35 cotton to polyester respectively.I've ordered many, many shirts and the blend is the way to go in all cases.  I know everyone says cotton, but blends give you so much more in durability, comfort, moisture wicking properties, and bright colors.  I never by 100 percent of x in any shirt, it's always a blend.This looks great with jeans as casual wear; you can't go wrong and there is a wide selection or product with Legendary Whitetails store.Be careful on the care instructions as the tag states this may bleed if washed with white colors in warm to hot water.  It's best to do the first wash by itself and then wax the shirt with a water repellant wax to waterproof it.",so this is designed to be worn as either a jacket or a shirt allowing you to layer it in and wear it on cold blustery daysi am   tall with an athletic build and the large was quite big  i know its to allow for a shirt underneath to be worn as a jacket but it was just too big for me  i returned it and ordered the medium which gives it a tailored looki plan to wear it here in denver as a cold weather jacket and then as a shirt in the spring and summer  its really a great concept and allows for yearround wear denver is actually a very temperate climate but plan accordingly depending on where you livei got the brown with the plaid inner shell and it looks great  this is a cottonpolyester blend with approximately  cotton to polyester respectivelyive ordered many many shirts and the blend is the way to go in all cases  i know everyone says cotton but blends give you so much more in durability comfort moisture wicking properties and bright colors  i never by  percent of x in any shirt its always a blendthis looks great with jeans as casual wear you cant go wrong and there is a wide selection or product with legendary whitetails storebe careful on the care instructions as the tag states this may bleed if washed with white colors in warm to hot water  its best to do the first wash by itself and then wax the shirt with a water repellant wax to waterproof it,1

"Let me start by saying that I have not had this jacket long enough to know how it will hold up over time but so far this jacket is amazing.FitAt 6'2 / 200 (long legs) I was tempted to get the XL but got the Large as I wanted something really light as I have a full winter coat but could not be happier with sizing of the Large.MaterialsThis jacket has a really soft and water resistant outer skin.  I placed my arm under my water spigot and the water just bounced off and two quick shakes of my arm and it was dry.  The inner liner is very good at storing body heat so you could probably get away with this being a three season jacket if you live in an area with relatively mild winters.FeaturesThere are four pockets on the jacket I have, two traditional waist-level jacket pockets on the left and right with an inner pocket and an outer left arm pocket.  The two hand pockets are decent but a little shallower than I expected.  The inner pocket is nicely sized and readily falls to hand.  I will likely never use left arm pocket as it feels odd to access and awkward to zip back up.  Speaking of zippers, all of them appear to be of at least decent quality as the zippers feel decently robust and the tracks are metal.  It is a bit annoying that the main zipper on this jacket is on the left which is different than any other jacket I have owned and takes a little brain retraining to get use to.OverallI have spent a lot of money on jackets in the past but also got my money's worth.  I went a bit cheaper this time but I am pretty impressed even in the short time I've worn this one.  I will add an edit if this impression changes due to unexpected quirks or wear.December 2023 Update: 2nd JacketThis jacket has been great and despite rolling around on concrete more often than I cared to as well as doing a lot of other more tasks that would cause wear, I bought a new one to wear when going out.  I am happy to report that the new one has the zipper on the traditional western right side of the jacket and there appears to be more insulation in it as well (still not bulky though).  I am still using the previous one for working on cars and such.",let me start by saying that i have not had this jacket long enough to know how it will hold up over time but so far this jacket is amazingfitat    long legs i was tempted to get the xl but got the large as i wanted something really light as i have a full winter coat but could not be happier with sizing of the largematerialsthis jacket has a really soft and water resistant outer skin  i placed my arm under my water spigot and the water just bounced off and two quick shakes of my arm and it was dry  the inner liner is very good at storing body heat so you could probably get away with this being a three season jacket if you live in an area with relatively mild wintersfeaturesthere are four pockets on the jacket i have two traditional waistlevel jacket pockets on the left and right with an inner pocket and an outer left arm pocket  the two hand pockets are decent but a little shallower than i expected  the inner pocket is nicely sized and readily falls to hand  i will likely never use left arm pocket as it feels odd to access and awkward to zip back up  speaking of zippers all of them appear to be of at least decent quality as the zippers feel decently robust and the tracks are metal  it is a bit annoying that the main zipper on this jacket is on the left which is different than any other jacket i have owned and takes a little brain retraining to get use tooveralli have spent a lot of money on jackets in the past but also got my moneys worth  i went a bit cheaper this time but i am pretty impressed even in the short time ive worn this one  i will add an edit if this impression changes due to unexpected quirks or weardecember  update nd jacketthis jacket has been great and despite rolling around on concrete more often than i cared to as well as doing a lot of other more tasks that would cause wear i bought a new one to wear when going out  i am happy to report that the new one has the zipper on the traditional western right side of the jacket and there appears to be more insulation in it as well still not bulky though  i am still using the previous one for working on cars and such,1

"These initially felt a little 90's swishy pants to me when I opened them and they were fairly wrinkled. A quick wash and the wrinkles came out. They say to hand wash but I just threw them on a delicate cycle and hung them to dry. Wore them to Disney World and put 20,000 steps in a 12 hour day in them. These things are great! They were so light and breathable. Did I sweat in them? You bet I did. Did they dry super fast? You bet they did. I never once felt like they were riding up or bunched up my boxers like my $60 Under Armour golf shorts did the next day at the park. I never noticed the infamous 90's swishy pants sound while walking all those steps. And believe me, my two daughters certainly would have pointed that out. I was able to keep my money clip and Pixel 5 XL in the front pockets. I never once felt worried that my phone would fall out of my pocket. Even with the extra  phone weight I didn't have to tie the drawstring. I didn't think that the pockets were sagging either with the extra weight. I'm 5' 9 182 lbs with an athletic build (I could spare to lose 5-10 pounds in the stomach) and I measured myself as a medium. So that is what I ordered. I will say that they are a bit if a slim/tailored fit and the bottoms were definitely an inch or so above my knees. That's what I wanted so I am happy I went with the medium.

"I bought these Levi Strauss men's bootcut jeans for my teenage son, and he absolutely loves them! The fit is perfect—not too tight, not too loose—just the right amount of room for comfort while still looking stylish. The bootcut design is great because it works well with his boots and gives a classic, laid-back look that never goes out of style.The quality is exactly what you expect from Levi’s—durable, well-stitched, and made with high-quality denim that holds up through daily wear. The fabric is soft but strong, with just a little stretch that allows for movement without feeling too stiff or baggy.

The waist fits comfortably and stays in place without needing a belt, which is a huge plus for him.

"Loved these jeans. Feel and quality is excellent.I purchased the med wash in 18 regular length & dark wash in tall, 16L.  I'm 5'9 with long legs and length on both worked.  The recommended size was 18.  I normally wear a 16.  The 18 fit better in the waist but was baggy in the legs below the butt.  The16L was just a little snug in the waist but perfect fit in the hips and legs.  My plan was to see which size was the better fit and return the other.  I kept both pairs and love them both, but I prefer the overall fit of the size 16.

"I've been using the Champion Athletic Shorts for several months now, primarily for my morning elliptical workouts, and they have quickly become my go-to shorts. The fit is true to size, and I love how they are loose-fitting without feeling baggy. The lightweight fabric is incredibly comfortable and breathable, which is perfect for my intense cardio sessions. Plus, the Double Dry technology really works wonders, keeping me dry and comfortable throughout my workouts.One of my favorite features is the side pockets, which are perfect for holding my keys and other essentials. The elastic drawcord waistband allows for a custom fit.  Despite numerous washes, these shorts show little signs of wear, which speaks to their durability. The iconic C logo patch at the hem is a nice touch, adding a bit of style.

There is room for an insole/orthotic/ arch support without taking out the insole they come with.They offer support but not enough cushioning for running. Better to get options like Adidas  alphabounce or New Balance fresh foam x or good budget high foam runners like  Allswifit.These adidas are very much like a cozy pair of moccasins you love.

"Ok, I’m not sure why anyone would leave a negative review or why these are high return items, but my experience has been exceptional. My son had been wearing his regular jeans to work (landscaping) and was absolutely destroying them. He needed work pants and he’s hard to fit (29x34) because he’s tall and lanky. I didn’t have a lot of money to spend and because of his odd size, I came straight to Amazon. These pants appeared on my second swipe up and I saw that one color was on sale for $9.99. I originally ordered him 3 pairs of the sale pants, but ordered him 30x34’s because that’s what he wanted. Got them in 2 days with my Prime and they were perfect for his needs, though he needed a 29” waist.  My son loves how comfortable they are and he says they’re much cooler than jeans. He can wear the 30’s, but I decided to order him some in his regular size of 29x34. I will say that he probably could have gone down to 33” length, possibly 32”, but with his cowboy boots, the 34” are fine. I’m thinking the pants might be slightly big in the waist and length measurements, so you might want to order one size smaller in both dimensions. They aren’t huge, just maybe an inch bigger. So here I go to order more pants and I saw there were 2 additional colors on sale except these were $6.62. What?!?! I couldn’t believe it! I immediately ordered him 6 additional pairs, 4 of one color and 2 of the other. Those 6 pairs were less than $10 more in total than my first order. I couldn’t believe it because I already knew the pants were well made. They hold up very well during washing and they don’t wrinkle. (Hallelujah!)  I mean can you imagine a better deal? The pants are appropriate for dinner, church, work (any kind), really anywhere you’d wear a pair of khakis. I could not be happier with this purchase and urge you to buy them if you’re on the fence. They are totally worth the price, especially if you catch an amazing sale like I did. You’ll be amazed at the quality versus price point and if you manage to get them for $6.62 it’ll make your day! Make sure you check all the colors because they don’t all cost the same. You don’t want to miss an opportunity to get them at rock bottom prices. Trust me, buy them! You won’t regret it.",ok i’m not sure why anyone would leave a negative review or why these are high return items but my experience has been exceptional my son had been wearing his regular jeans to work landscaping and was absolutely destroying them he needed work pants and he’s hard to fit x because he’s tall and lanky i didn’t have a lot of money to spend and because of his odd size i came straight to amazon these pants appeared on my second swipe up and i saw that one color was on sale for  i originally ordered him  pairs of the sale pants but ordered him x’s because that’s what he wanted got them in  days with my prime and they were perfect for his needs though he needed a ” waist  my son loves how comfortable they are and he says they’re much cooler than jeans he can wear the ’s but i decided to order him some in his regular size of x i will say that he probably could have gone down to ” length possibly ” but with his cowboy boots the ” are fine i’m thinking the pants might be slightly big in the waist and length measurements so you might want to order one size smaller in both dimensions they aren’t huge just maybe an inch bigger so here i go to order more pants and i saw there were  additional colors on sale except these were  what i couldn’t believe it i immediately ordered him  additional pairs  of one color and  of the other those  pairs were less than  more in total than my first order i couldn’t believe it because i already knew the pants were well made they hold up very well during washing and they don’t wrinkle hallelujah  i mean can you imagine a better deal the pants are appropriate for dinner church work any kind really anywhere you’d wear a pair of khakis i could not be happier with this purchase and urge you to buy them if you’re on the fence they are totally worth the price especially if you catch an amazing sale like i did you’ll be amazed at the quality versus price point and if you manage to get them for  it’ll make your day make sure you check all the colors because they don’t all cost the same you don’t want to miss an opportunity to get them at rock bottom prices trust me buy them you won’t regret it,1

"Getting a bit older, and hence a bit fatter-- as we will-- I realized I needed a more roomy fit in my jeans. Looked at these #569 Levi's.Bought them.The fit is exactly what I'd hoped it would be. Not exactly baggy, but looser than the #517 bootcut jeans I've worn all my life.I like them, but I must always mention the loss of value and longevity in products these days. These Levi's are quite thin. The denim is heavily washed-- which the company realizes will drastically reduce the lifespan of the item.And it began thinner, even before being processed. Denim was at one time a very thick and durable fabric. No more.The ordinary retail price for these is nearly seventy dollars.I might be old, and I admit that, but I get irritated by the constant cheapening of our clothing-- to reduce its usable life and compel another purchase.",getting a bit older and hence a bit fatter as we will i realized i needed a more roomy fit in my jeans looked at these  levisbought themthe fit is exactly what id hoped it would be not exactly baggy but looser than the  bootcut jeans ive worn all my lifei like them but i must always mention the loss of value and longevity in products these days these levis are quite thin the denim is heavily washed which the company realizes will drastically reduce the lifespan of the itemand it began thinner even before being processed denim was at one time a very thick and durable fabric no morethe ordinary retail price for these is nearly seventy dollarsi might be old and i admit that but i get irritated by the constant cheapening of our clothing to reduce its usable life and compel another purchase,1

"Length and size is perfect. Is a little big but that means it's perfect for layering underneath. Like with a sweater or hoodie. It's water resistant, but definitely not waterproof. I wouldn't stand out in heavy rain for a long time wearing this. But holds up fine to medium rainfall and snowfall for short periods of time. Definitely not all day though. Is fairly heavy but to be expected. It is warm but not too bulky feeling. Has two front pockets that have no zipper or button to keep them closed. But I don't mind. I really wish this coat did have some sort of inner pocket. I am 6'2 and the 4 XL one reaches down past my knees.

"I was a bit hesitant to order these shoes because I've myself never heard of Brooks. I took them out of the box and thought That is a really thick sole. And then I put them on my feet and I was thrilled nearly 100%.Pros- The regular width shoe is perfect for someone who has a generally skinny foot but a slightly wider ball of foot area. This has been a challenge for my entire life and I've often had to either buy wide shoes that make my feet swim or have shoes that are too tight around my toes and ball of my foot.- The toe area is long enough over center to accommodate those of us with a long second toe, or Greek toe. This can be especially helpful if you suffer pain or potential hammer toe due to cramped shoes. My other toes feel supported and don't feel like they're swimming, but my long toe also has plenty of room and support.- The cushy support from the nitrogen injected spongey soles is something I never knew I needed.- The arch support feel fantastic for high arches. I didn't even feel the need to switch out the insole.- The top of the shoe is stretchy and breathable.- I have felt comfortable and supported since I started wearing these about a week ago. I had major foot surgery in 2021 and have had issues with my feet and toes ever since. These don't solve all those problems but I feel a lot better. I didn't feel like I could comfortably walk 10,000 steps per day and now I do. I'm going over 13,000+ per day.- They were easy to wear even without breaking in. I've had only minimal breaking in pains and that is a really big deal for me because that's never been the case before.Cons- The shape and height of the heel back on this shoe rubs into my heel, not just on the bridge but on the sides as well. This meant that I had to buy socks with a heel tab on them. I am not a huge fan of those kinds of socks because they are always super thick. This means that a lot of the glorious room I got in these shoes was then taken away from me by thick socks that I didn't even want to buy. So just remember that if you buy these shoes you now also have to buy $20 of socks.- The shoelaces are not typical for tennis shoes and they're the kind of tubular ones. This means that they are harder to untie and more likely to get stuck in annoying knots.- I had to relearn to walk in these shoes. The sole is so thick and springy that walking is not intuitive at first. I fell off my walking pad the first time I used it with these shoes.Overall, these are really great shoes and I highly recommend them.",i was a bit hesitant to order these shoes because ive myself never heard of brooks i took them out of the box and thought that is a really thick sole and then i put them on my feet and i was thrilled nearly pros the regular width shoe is perfect for someone who has a generally skinny foot but a slightly wider ball of foot area this has been a challenge for my entire life and ive often had to either buy wide shoes that make my feet swim or have shoes that are too tight around my toes and ball of my foot the toe area is long enough over center to accommodate those of us with a long second toe or greek toe this can be especially helpful if you suffer pain or potential hammer toe due to cramped shoes my other toes feel supported and dont feel like theyre swimming but my long toe also has plenty of room and support the cushy support from the nitrogen injected spongey soles is something i never knew i needed the arch support feel fantastic for high arches i didnt even feel the need to switch out the insole the top of the shoe is stretchy and breathable i have felt comfortable and supported since i started wearing these about a week ago i had major foot surgery in  and have had issues with my feet and toes ever since these dont solve all those problems but i feel a lot better i didnt feel like i could comfortably walk  steps per day and now i do im going over  per day they were easy to wear even without breaking in ive had only minimal breaking in pains and that is a really big deal for me because thats never been the case beforecons the shape and height of the heel back on this shoe rubs into my heel not just on the bridge but on the sides as well this meant that i had to buy socks with a heel tab on them i am not a huge fan of those kinds of socks because they are always super thick this means that a lot of the glorious room i got in these shoes was then taken away from me by thick socks that i didnt even want to buy so just remember that if you buy these shoes you now also have to buy  of socks the shoelaces are not typical for tennis shoes and theyre the kind of tubular ones this means that they are harder to untie and more likely to get stuck in annoying knots i had to relearn to walk in these shoes the sole is so thick and springy that walking is not intuitive at first i fell off my walking pad the first time i used it with these shoesoverall these are really great shoes and i highly recommend them,1

"Update 3 - Fingers Crossed, I've re-ordered again.  Its a great looking jacket, and the material is better than most.  I've had similar, that were a little warmer.  But I've definitely had several similar.  And am still leaving this as a 5 star item.  If all goes well it'll be nice to keep wearing, and I do think its especially stylish..Update 2 - I ordered myself another of these jackets, but what I received was greasy, stained, dirty, piling, hairy, opened, and tagless.  See images.  This was in the Return Pile at the UPS store within an hour of my receiving it!Update 1 - Its been a couple years I've been wearing this jacket now.  When I first got it I noticed the zipper was hard to pull, almost like it was cross threaded somehow; that never went away.  I figured after 2 years that was the way it was.  I'm surprised it lasted a couple years, almost exactly.I love this material, I live in New England; our weather changes to the extreme day to day.  This is the jacket Material I wear most often(Fall Spring and half of the Winter.)  This is my 5th jacket like this, but my first with an extra warm hood.  The size is pretty accurate.  I actually bought an XL and an XXL.  I like my coats large for style and I like to have room to layering underneath, so I kept the XXL; though the XL looked pretty sharp too(just without any layers,) I was stuck between the sizes.  I'm not sure my real Winter Coat would be much warmer with enough layers.  I may purchase a second, in another color; to be seen at night, and because it was a good enough deal I'd get mad if I ever ripped or lost one..",update   fingers crossed ive reordered again  its a great looking jacket and the material is better than most  ive had similar that were a little warmer  but ive definitely had several similar  and am still leaving this as a  star item  if all goes well itll be nice to keep wearing and i do think its especially stylishupdate   i ordered myself another of these jackets but what i received was greasy stained dirty piling hairy opened and tagless  see images  this was in the return pile at the ups store within an hour of my receiving itupdate   its been a couple years ive been wearing this jacket now  when i first got it i noticed the zipper was hard to pull almost like it was cross threaded somehow that never went away  i figured after  years that was the way it was  im surprised it lasted a couple years almost exactlyi love this material i live in new england our weather changes to the extreme day to day  this is the jacket material i wear most oftenfall spring and half of the winter  this is my th jacket like this but my first with an extra warm hood  the size is pretty accurate  i actually bought an xl and an xxl  i like my coats large for style and i like to have room to layering underneath so i kept the xxl though the xl looked pretty sharp toojust without any layers i was stuck between the sizes  im not sure my real winter coat would be much warmer with enough layers  i may purchase a second in another color to be seen at night and because it was a good enough deal id get mad if i ever ripped or lost one,1

"My husband has been a Wrangler man for probably the last 10 years. He used to be a hardcore Levi's guy, until their prices became ridiculous and the denim started completely wearing out after just a couple months of use.We used to go with the unwashed denim, for longer wear, but honestly, they were such a hassle and always got odd creases in them even with the most strict following of the instructions that we just decided to go with the PWD, which stands for Pre-Washed Denim.Things to note about the Cowboy Cut 936pwd style:1) These pants are supposed to fit at your natural waist, not your hips! Your natural waist is above your hip bones, and USUALLY can be found in line with the middle of your belly button. If you don't know how to find your natural waist, look it up- lots of helpful pics and articles.2) These pants are supposed to fit snugly! They are not supposed to be baggy at all.3) These pants may shrink a bit, so if you are on the edge of sizing up because these are already a bit uncomfortable, size up!4.) These pants fit best on people/men who are long and lean. I say this because they are so snug, and sit at your natural waist. Some may find this too constricting.My husband does manual labor for a living as a glazier. Wranglers have been awesome at protecting his legs from some crazy scary glass shards that have ripped other people's sissy brand pants to shreds. They have always been well worth the cost. A pair of Wranglers typically will last my husband about a year and a half to two years depending on how many he has on rotation. During lean times, if he only has, say 3 pair on rotation, they may last about a year due to the increased wash and wear. I recently splurged when I saw that Amazon had an amazing price on these babies, putting them at less than half of retail. So I bought 6 for less than I would have in store for 3. Sweet!!If you are a lean person like my husband, who looks like they are wearing their older and bigger sibling's pants when you try on Original fit or Relaxed fit and you DON'T want to look disheveled/unprofessional, these pants are for you.  They look tailor-made to fit your body, and they are classy and professional looking.No butt bling, or saggy britches showing off your boxers here! These here are real man's pants.I have pictures of a pair that he has been wearing for about 6 months, that we purchased in store, compared to a pair I bought from Amazon, brand new out of the box.Note that the older pair have shrunk by about 2 inches. Now, I didn't measure the store bought ones when we brought them home, but they always fit him a little long and then after a few weeks of wash, they fit just right in the length.The only difference in the two pair is that the store bought ones were made in Mexico of U.S denim, and the ones I purchased from Amazon are made in Nicaragua from U.S. denim. Not sure if Wrangler switched their manufacturer (again) or if they have different manufacturing places for different sellers.I have already washed these several times and they have been in his rotation for about a month. They have conformed nicely as expected to his frame, and he has expressed no complaints.All in all, if you want some nice, presentable pants that are professional looking, durable as all get out, or maybe some nice jeans for Sunday dinners, church, or a night out, look no further!",my husband has been a wrangler man for probably the last  years he used to be a hardcore levis guy until their prices became ridiculous and the denim started completely wearing out after just a couple months of usewe used to go with the unwashed denim for longer wear but honestly they were such a hassle and always got odd creases in them even with the most strict following of the instructions that we just decided to go with the pwd which stands for prewashed denimthings to note about the cowboy cut pwd style these pants are supposed to fit at your natural waist not your hips your natural waist is above your hip bones and usually can be found in line with the middle of your belly button if you dont know how to find your natural waist look it up lots of helpful pics and articles these pants are supposed to fit snugly they are not supposed to be baggy at all these pants may shrink a bit so if you are on the edge of sizing up because these are already a bit uncomfortable size up these pants fit best on peoplemen who are long and lean i say this because they are so snug and sit at your natural waist some may find this too constrictingmy husband does manual labor for a living as a glazier wranglers have been awesome at protecting his legs from some crazy scary glass shards that have ripped other peoples sissy brand pants to shreds they have always been well worth the cost a pair of wranglers typically will last my husband about a year and a half to two years depending on how many he has on rotation during lean times if he only has say  pair on rotation they may last about a year due to the increased wash and wear i recently splurged when i saw that amazon had an amazing price on these babies putting them at less than half of retail so i bought  for less than i would have in store for  sweetif you are a lean person like my husband who looks like they are wearing their older and bigger siblings pants when you try on original fit or relaxed fit and you dont want to look disheveledunprofessional these pants are for you  they look tailormade to fit your body and they are classy and professional lookingno butt bling or saggy britches showing off your boxers here these here are real mans pantsi have pictures of a pair that he has been wearing for about  months that we purchased in store compared to a pair i bought from amazon brand new out of the boxnote that the older pair have shrunk by about  inches now i didnt measure the store bought ones when we brought them home but they always fit him a little long and then after a few weeks of wash they fit just right in the lengththe only difference in the two pair is that the store bought ones were made in mexico of us denim and the ones i purchased from amazon are made in nicaragua from us denim not sure if wrangler switched their manufacturer again or if they have different manufacturing places for different sellersi have already washed these several times and they have been in his rotation for about a month they have conformed nicely as expected to his frame and he has expressed no complaintsall in all if you want some nice presentable pants that are professional looking durable as all get out or maybe some nice jeans for sunday dinners church or a night out look no further,1

"Ah Yes, Levi's are THE standard. No matter what I buy, Levi's are my go to.With this said, the 511's fit me well, no Clown like baggy legs.

"This brand's not always been consistent for me, although their clothes are always attractive. This Green top is definitely a hit! It not only looks true to the Amazon product photos with the model. But it's sized right too. The Large is a pretty relaxed fit on my daughter, who's in between sizes L-XL or 14-16 in tops on her 5'4 busty apple-shaped figure. I recommend sizing down since this top's made on the loose & flowy side. She really likes how the ruched design in the top  front and the long half-sleeves with the slits on top keeps the eyes looking upward on her. She also likes how it finished its mid-length hemline with gentle ruffles.

I don't mean like 55% cotton 45% poly or some petroleum based product, thats what polyester is, its like wearing a rubber diving suit.THEY'RE GOOD PANTS!!!", cotton  spandex for stretch comfort good product what else can i say ya know fashion today is produced with fabrics that may look good till you put them on and find out you sweat because theres a synthetic like polyester in the blend that may be alright for some but i must wear real cotton as the dominant fabric in the blend i dont mean like  cotton  poly or some petroleum based product thats what polyester is its like wearing a rubber diving suittheyre good pants,1

"This shirt has pleasantly surprised me! I love it and i am ordering more. The quality is very good. I was worried about it being thin and see through, but it is not. The material is cool and comfortable, not too silky and not 1 bit itchy or scratchy. The neckline is perfect for professional or casual. The shirt is meant to be loose and flowy so don't expect a form fit. If you are looking for a shapely fit you will have to tuck in the front as shown on the model. The only reason i took 1 star off is because of the length of the shirt. I am forgiving of it because i am 5'3 with a small chest. Someone taller and chestier probably wouldnt have this issue.

"I'm 6'4 and not a super model. I wouldn't... um, couldn't... do the splits in them.

These fit as comfortably as $60 Dillard's jeans.Selvedge sewing and thick oz flex denim for outdoor use for $30 would be reasonable to me. I believe in things being well made. I have no problem with fashion, as long as it does the job for the right price. Mass manufactured can do good sewing. Not hard. Everyone has YKK zippers now. Why not beat that? I'd rather care about a product and improve it. Canvas bell tents > plastic garbage. So these pants are store quality. Not grandpa quality and long term, but not like the Lee's I got off Amazon that had major sewing problems. A little loose thread in the button hole, easily fixed with a flame. But otherwise a great buy.They are very comfortable with a little stretch in the fabric. Thin, but not paper thin. Just not heavy duty. Great for daily wearing. The only flaw I've found was small. The hole for the button above the zipper had a bit of loose thread in the inner circle. A quick flame will fix it easily enough. Otherwise, no issues. The Pittsburgh color is slightly darker than the picture, like a hint of deep ocean blue in it.

"I have two teenage boys, who are full-figured and at the top of the height curve. My 14-year-old is now 6 ft tall and 260 lb. I bought these pants a while back. I was thinking that I was buying standard sweatpants in a three pack. I was not thrilled when I opened the pack to find a very strange texture I think. However after, I don't have to wear them, so I presented them to him to be honest, I expected him to reject them out of hand. To my surprise. He tried them all on and said that he liked them. He has been wearing them for months now. They have held up very well in the wash. Unlike traditional cotton or polyester, Jay are not going to pill. They are extremely stretchy they do look nicer than what you would think from my description. So yeah, if my son wanted me to buy them again, I would. But if I had touched them about before purchasing them, I would not have bought them .Just for reference, my son is extremely picky about his clothes. He will not even wear a shirt with pink or purple in it because he thinks it looks feminine. A major plus of these pants are the zippered pockets. They can hold his iPhone 13 and his beats securely. The material feels thin to me, and I would not want to wear it in the winter. However, it seems to be fine for him. Since he is doing this whole teenage thing of wearing giant hoodies when it's 90° outside, at least these pants don't seem so outrageous.",i have two teenage boys who are fullfigured and at the top of the height curve my yearold is now  ft tall and  lb i bought these pants a while back i was thinking that i was buying standard sweatpants in a three pack i was not thrilled when i opened the pack to find a very strange texture i think however after i dont have to wear them so i presented them to him to be honest i expected him to reject them out of hand to my surprise he tried them all on and said that he liked them he has been wearing them for months now they have held up very well in the wash unlike traditional cotton or polyester jay are not going to pill they are extremely stretchy they do look nicer than what you would think from my description so yeah if my son wanted me to buy them again i would but if i had touched them about before purchasing them i would not have bought them just for reference my son is extremely picky about his clothes he will not even wear a shirt with pink or purple in it because he thinks it looks feminine a major plus of these pants are the zippered pockets they can hold his iphone  and his beats securely the material feels thin to me and i would not want to wear it in the winter however it seems to be fine for him since he is doing this whole teenage thing of wearing giant hoodies when its ° outside at least these pants dont seem so outrageous,1

"I am 5' 10 tall and 172 lbs., and old. I wear a 41 suit. The size L fit the way I like. Because some reviewers suggested they were cut small, I bought XL. They were huge, and I returned them for size L. I have work 3 of them for indoor workouts in a temperate climate (low to mid 70s, within 2 miles of the ocean). They were comfortable. And, they look good. They are easy to wash and come out of the dryer wrinkle free.But, they arrived with that chemical smell common to microfiber clothes.  Realessentials included a card inviting the user to email them for any issues, but I elected to try self-help.  I washed them in Kirkland Free, and the odor diminished. I ran them through the dryer a second time, with a Bounce dryer sheet, and they were much improved. (Do not use fabric softener or dryer sheets on microfiber towels. They will lose their absorbency.  I don't think it hurt the shirts).  Then, I rewashed them with Downey fragrance free laundry detergent and dried them without a dryer sheet.  After that, they were suitable for wear.

"I was skeptical on the price but needed a new winter jacket as I recently relocated from Florida to Northern Texas and we get weather in the low teens during the winter months. This jacket is warm, first time I wore it, was 17 degrees outside and all I had underneath was a long sleeve shirt I wasn’t bothered by the cold at all. I notice a lot of people say buy a size up I got a medium I’m 6 foot about 175 lbs and it fit great. My only thing is engraving things like “fashion” on the buttons and the “fashion, sport” leather badge on the left sleeve are a little tacky, (I actually took the badge on the sleeve off with a needle and small knife), but for the money this is a great jacket that seems durable, fits to size and will keep you plenty warm in at least the weather conditions that I have explained.",i was skeptical on the price but needed a new winter jacket as i recently relocated from florida to northern texas and we get weather in the low teens during the winter months this jacket is warm first time i wore it was  degrees outside and all i had underneath was a long sleeve shirt i wasn’t bothered by the cold at all i notice a lot of people say buy a size up i got a medium i’m  foot about  lbs and it fit great my only thing is engraving things like “fashion” on the buttons and the “fashion sport” leather badge on the left sleeve are a little tacky i actually took the badge on the sleeve off with a needle and small knife but for the money this is a great jacket that seems durable fits to size and will keep you plenty warm in at least the weather conditions that i have explained,1

"These pants are pretty darn excellent!  Here‚Äôs the size info to help you buy the correct size.Me- 5‚Äô7‚Äù long legs! 170#pictures are the size 16.I always wear L (long) pants.  I was already wearing Lee brand jeans which stretched.  I started with a 12L, but gained weight and was wearing a 16L until I found these.The previous Lee jeans had a waistband which came up to hip area.But sadly I faced medical problems and consoled myself with ice cream.  The medical problems were caused by the surgeon who  left me with a deformed foot.  It is very hard to get enough exercise when you can‚Äôt really walk well let alone run, jog, skip rope or do any other stuff that would help.Ice cream + inactivity = fatness.  Anyone who goes from a size 12 to a 16 has no business wearing jeans which don‚Äôt have enough fabric to make it up to the hip bones any longer. I‚Äôm sure I looked like some chubby middle aged woman who should look in the mirror and stop dressing inappropriately.These jeans stretch pretty much all over. I ordered a pair in Amazon‚Äôs recommended of size 14 but also in the size I suspected was better for me, size 16.I took reviewer‚Äôs advice and did not get ‚ÄúLong‚Äù.This was sound advice, the long‚Äôs would have required hemming.I tried the size 16 first- they are incredibly comfortable and soft. They are roomy in the right places and the waist band height is much better.  The crotch area was an exception though. That shouldn‚Äôt feel like there‚Äôs extra unneeded fabric, but it did. After washing this hasn‚Äôt bothered me.  I do need a belt to keep these up if my phone is in the pocket.Next I tried the size 14. I‚Äôm fairly confident that they will fit better if I lost 5 pounds. Otherwise I can wear them but the fit feels too small and I suspect they might look too small. I actually ordered another size 16 so that I have more than one pair of blue jeans to wear.Highly recommend these jeans no matter what body shape. If you are struggling with waistbands, which are too tight these jeans have more than enough stretch in the fabric. The waistband doesn‚Äôt roll or curl over after bending down and the length, even after washing has stayed exactly like it was when I got them I did not need to buy long. The regular length is quite long enough.  Ever so grateful this brand has mastered making a denim material which stretches but still looks like a normal blue jean,  It is soft and a joy to wear.",these pants are pretty darn excellent  here‚äôs the size info to help you buy the correct sizeme ‚äô‚äù long legs pictures are the size i always wear l long pants  i was already wearing lee brand jeans which stretched  i started with a l but gained weight and was wearing a l until i found thesethe previous lee jeans had a waistband which came up to hip areabut sadly i faced medical problems and consoled myself with ice cream  the medical problems were caused by the surgeon who  left me with a deformed foot  it is very hard to get enough exercise when you can‚äôt really walk well let alone run jog skip rope or do any other stuff that would helpice cream  inactivity  fatness  anyone who goes from a size  to a  has no business wearing jeans which don‚äôt have enough fabric to make it up to the hip bones any longer i‚äôm sure i looked like some chubby middle aged woman who should look in the mirror and stop dressing inappropriatelythese jeans stretch pretty much all over i ordered a pair in amazon‚äôs recommended of size  but also in the size i suspected was better for me size i took reviewer‚äôs advice and did not get ‚äúlong‚äùthis was sound advice the long‚äôs would have required hemmingi tried the size  first they are incredibly comfortable and soft they are roomy in the right places and the waist band height is much better  the crotch area was an exception though that shouldn‚äôt feel like there‚äôs extra unneeded fabric but it did after washing this hasn‚äôt bothered me  i do need a belt to keep these up if my phone is in the pocketnext i tried the size  i‚äôm fairly confident that they will fit better if i lost  pounds otherwise i can wear them but the fit feels too small and i suspect they might look too small i actually ordered another size  so that i have more than one pair of blue jeans to wearhighly recommend these jeans no matter what body shape if you are struggling with waistbands which are too tight these jeans have more than enough stretch in the fabric the waistband doesn‚äôt roll or curl over after bending down and the length even after washing has stayed exactly like it was when i got them i did not need to buy long the regular length is quite long enough  ever so grateful this brand has mastered making a denim material which stretches but still looks like a normal blue jean  it is soft and a joy to wear,1

"The Brooks Glycerin has been my go-to sneaker for years. I’ve already been professionally fitted a few times and this is usually the winner, so I wasn’t buying blind. I’d been squeezing the last bit of life out of my 20s when faced with the decision of going for the 21s or the new 22s. The 21s were marked down due to the release of the 22s, but it’s all about comfort. Several running reviews guided me to the 21s over the 22s. I’ve got about 85 miles on them so far and I love them. Bonus points for an ultra bright color with top notch reflective elements.

"I've been searching for a high-quality winter jacket for quite some time, and I'm so glad I stumbled upon this one. From the moment I put it on, I was impressed by the incredible warmth it provides. Even in temperatures as low as 10°F, I've been able to stay comfortably warm without needing additional layers.The secret to this jacket's warmth lies in its Sorona Aura filler. This innovative material is known for its exceptional thermal insulation properties, and it's the same filler used by premium brands like Spyder, who charge upwards of $300 for their jackets. The fact that this jacket offers the same premium quality filler at a fraction of the cost is simply remarkable.Aside from its outstanding warmth, I'm also blown away by the jacket's stylish design and comfortable fit. It's incredibly lightweight and doesn't feel bulky or restrictive at all. The materials used are top-notch, and the stitching is impeccable. I can confidently say that this jacket is built to last.Overall, I'm absolutely thrilled with my purchase of this jacket. It's an exceptional value that surpasses my expectations in every way.

"These shorts fit well, are comfortable, and the pockets are quite nice and hold heavier items well enough for me.

The only problem is they’re over twice as much as these shorts.Conclusively these are a great pair of shorts that serve well and are worth the money.

However, keep in mind that if you choose the gray color, sweat can be more noticeable, which might be a factor for some buyers.

"I would just like to start off by saying that this jacket fits well and there are some reviews that I have read giving it a low amount of stars and saying that the pockets aren't real.Perhaps they got a defective jacket but all of the pockets on mine are functional and real.It is pretty durable and water seems to bead off of it although I imagine like anything water will get through eventually especially if you're swimming with it.The fleece interior is very warm and comfortable.I see in other reviews as well that they mentioned the zipper is on the wrong side. The zipper mechanism is on the left hand side instead of the right hand side which really doesn't matter to me it functions I am not concerned with zipper etiquette.Some people are led to believe that this is a woman's jacket because the zipper is on the left, well I've seen soft shell jackets for women as I bought some for my partner and they are usually pleated around the upper chest and armpit area to allow room for breasts. This jacket is not pleated in such a way so I would say that's wrong.Although women can wear the jacket I'm just saying it does not possess that pleat that allows extra room for lady partsI would love if this had an attachable Hood as it does not the hood is permanently attached but can be rolled away although I'm not sure why you would want to anyway but you can you have options.That does not detract from the quality of the jacket in any way as it is not stated as having a removable Hood so there's no reason to deduct a star for that.This jacket will keep you warm it will keep you protected and it looks good. It's true to size as far as I can say and the material is satisfactory.It does have pull cords within to adjust the fit of the jacket as well as the hood and in other reviews I have taken note that they report their jacket not having retention clasps for the chords but mine does.Again I don't know if they got it defective jacket or if this jacket has changed and the company has fixed the issues. But that being said my jacket is complete and it has everything the bad reviews say it does not so quite happy with it.",i would just like to start off by saying that this jacket fits well and there are some reviews that i have read giving it a low amount of stars and saying that the pockets arent realperhaps they got a defective jacket but all of the pockets on mine are functional and realit is pretty durable and water seems to bead off of it although i imagine like anything water will get through eventually especially if youre swimming with itthe fleece interior is very warm and comfortablei see in other reviews as well that they mentioned the zipper is on the wrong side the zipper mechanism is on the left hand side instead of the right hand side which really doesnt matter to me it functions i am not concerned with zipper etiquettesome people are led to believe that this is a womans jacket because the zipper is on the left well ive seen soft shell jackets for women as i bought some for my partner and they are usually pleated around the upper chest and armpit area to allow room for breasts this jacket is not pleated in such a way so i would say thats wrongalthough women can wear the jacket im just saying it does not possess that pleat that allows extra room for lady partsi would love if this had an attachable hood as it does not the hood is permanently attached but can be rolled away although im not sure why you would want to anyway but you can you have optionsthat does not detract from the quality of the jacket in any way as it is not stated as having a removable hood so theres no reason to deduct a star for thatthis jacket will keep you warm it will keep you protected and it looks good its true to size as far as i can say and the material is satisfactoryit does have pull cords within to adjust the fit of the jacket as well as the hood and in other reviews i have taken note that they report their jacket not having retention clasps for the chords but mine doesagain i dont know if they got it defective jacket or if this jacket has changed and the company has fixed the issues but that being said my jacket is complete and it has everything the bad reviews say it does not so quite happy with it,1
"Great button down. Very versatile for work or casual. Fabric is lightweight, great feel against the skin. White blouse is not see thru as long as you wear skin tone undergarment. Really like the elastic sleeve, great alternative to rolling up long sleeves.  Very feminine, stylish and comfortable. It’s a boyfriend fit so it’s roomy. The elastic on the arms is fitted so they hold up very well.  Personally I do not find the elastic too tight. For my arm size it is comfortably snug that I don’t need to fuss with because it’s sliding or because it’s too tight. With that being said others could find it constricting. Bought one in black and another in white. Like that the buttons match the fabric. Blouse has side pockets which is great if you were the blouse out.  Once tucked in the pockets for me are not functional. Washes well, I hung to dry, minimal wrinkles, light steam or ironing. Highly recommend.",great button down very versatile for work or casual fabric is lightweight great feel against the skin white blouse is not see thru as long as you wear skin tone undergarment really like the elastic sleeve great alternative to rolling up long sleeves  very feminine stylish and comfortable it’s a boyfriend fit so it’s roomy the elastic on the arms is fitted so they hold up very well  personally i do not find the elastic too tight for my arm size it is comfortably snug that i don’t need to fuss with because it’s sliding or because it’s too tight with that being said others could find it constricting bought one in black and another in white like that the buttons match the fabric blouse has side pockets which is great if you were the blouse out  once tucked in the pockets for me are not functional washes well i hung to dry minimal wrinkles light steam or ironing highly recommend,1

These boxers are a great price for the amount that you get. There are several pairs of boxers in the package and I like the color combination.

"I recently picked up a Hanes sweatshirt, and while it’s an okay option, it didn’t quite live up to my expectations compared to the Fruit of the Loom sweatshirts I’ve owned in the past.The fit is decent, and it’s comfortable enough for lounging around the house or running errands. However, I found that the fabric feels a bit thinner and less substantial than what I'm used to with Fruit of the Loom. While it keeps me warm, it lacks that cozy, heavyweight feel that I really enjoy in a sweatshirt.One thing I appreciated about the Hanes sweatshirt is the variety of colors and styles available, so there’s something for everyone. Still, in terms of overall quality and comfort, I would choose Fruit of the Loom any day.

"I compared this item to several pairs of cargo shorts purchased from a clothing seconds reseller.  Often high quality expensive items ended up here simply because the size label was incorrect, or stitching was slightly off.  Yet those were well made and lasted nearly a decade.  The Wrangler brand used to represent a quality pair of jeans, years ago.Pros:  Main advantage:  The fit is as advertised and comfortable in the crotch region and waistline.  The fabric is thin, this may be what you want if you prefer a lighter fabric.  There are 5 smaller cargo pockets instead of 2 large ones.  It uses Velcro pocket closures.  A side point regarding fit is that the crotch and groin region is snug in the Amazon Basics cargo shorts.  It's fine if you never sit down.

You won't be able to do that with these shorts, but you could carry all sorts of tiny doohickeys from your junk drawer such as marbles.  The larger of the 5 side pocket could not carry my smartphone.  In addition, the fabric is thin and is likely not durable, another one of the cheap disposable clothing.

"When it comes to finding the perfect summer top, I always look for comfort, versatility, and style. This casual women's summer top, made from 90% polyester and 10% elastane, ticks all these boxes and more. Whether I'm dressing up for the office or down for a casual day out, this shirt effortlessly adapts to any occasion. Here's why it's become a staple in my wardrobe.First off, this top is incredibly comfortable. The high-quality knitted fabric is soft and lightweight, giving it a cozy feel against my skin. The material blend of polyester and elastane offers just the right amount of stretch, so the shirt moves with me without feeling restrictive. It's a bit loose-fitting, which is perfect during the hotter months because it allows for better air circulation and has a relaxed vibe. Despite the loose fit, the material's elasticity ensures it drapes nicely, keeping it flattering.Style-wise, this shirt is a gem. The crew neck and batwing sleeves add a touch of elegance, while the pleated texture and classic solid color make it a standout piece. The design is simple yet stylish, making it easy to dress up or down. One of my favorite ways to wear this top is under a blazer for a polished office look. The crew neck provides a neat neckline that complements the sharp lines of a blazer, making it a great choice for professional settings.For a more casual look, pairing the top with white pants is a winning combination. The contrast of the solid color against white creates a fresh and clean look that's perfect for summer. Personally, my go-to outfit is this shirt with white jeans and a white denim jacket. This combo not only looks chic but also enhances my summer tan beautifully. The solid color of the top allows my tan to pop, giving me a radiant and healthy glow.This top is also incredibly versatile in how I can pair it with other wardrobe staples. Tucking the front of the shirt into skinny jeans or denim shorts creates a chic and stylish look that's perfect for a casual day out. Alternatively, wearing it with leggings provides a comfortable yet fashionable outfit for running errands or meeting friends for coffee. The top also pairs well with skirts, cardigans, heels, sandals, sneakers, and accessories like necklaces, making it a truly adaptable piece.Whether I'm heading to the office, going out for a date, attending a party, or just running errands, this top fits the bill. It's suitable for various occasions, including vacations, holidays, clubs, daily wear, school, and even workouts. The loose fit and lightweight fabric make it an excellent choice for summer, spring, fall, and winter, ensuring I get year-round wear out of it.Another great thing about this top is its easy care instructions. Being machine washable, it saves me time and effort, making it a practical addition to my wardrobe. The fabric holds up well after multiple washes, maintaining its shape, color, and softness, which speaks to its durability and high quality.All in all, this casual women's summer top is a fantastic addition to my wardrobe. Its combination of comfort, style, and versatility makes it a standout piece that I find myself reaching for time and again. Whether I'm dressing it up with a blazer for the office or keeping it casual with white jeans and a denim jacket, this top always makes me look and feel great.

"Lost a bunch of weight and needed new pants, so bought this and its smooth front cousin. The color is very dark, blue-black, so it is fairly dirt resistant. If it got dirty, quick dab with damp towel should take care of it, just don't let it soak in. Needs almost no ironing if you got it out of dryer when damp and hang it up with the pant legs folded properly.Should be worn with a belt, as the stretch is for emergencies. The stretch parts are hidden near the pleat and covered behind panels, which can be covered by the belt so they are completely invisible.The side pockets are a bit shallow, but perfectly usable. You don't buy these for pocket capacity.Once you wear they you'll find them to be quite comfortable, as the waist does stretch to accommodate sitting and so on.

"I have been looking for a nice pair of flattering, well-fitting dressier pants for over a year. I've returned multiple pairs and kept a few, but ended up taking most to Goodwill because they just didn't make me feel like I looked good in them. I had almost given up and tried these as a last resort, thinking I'd probably have to return them as well. But no, you can't pry these away from me, these will be my go to's for the foreseeable future. What I love:1. The fit. I bought Lee's for many years but quit buying them several years ago because the sizes were so inconsistent. I could try on a 14 that fit like a 10, and another 14 that fit like a 16.  They were also cut too tight for my liking. Not these, no sir. The 16 fit like a glove and made me look great. I felt like a million dollars in them, and they will go with anything.2. The wash. I threw them in the washer and then the dryer and they looked great. No shrinking at all, even though they are 50% cotton.3. The fabric. The cotton/polyester/elastane is a winner in my book, very comfortable to wear and they look good as well.4. The pockets. I have returned several pairs of dressy pants because the pockets were on the side of the pant. They stuck out and made my hips look really wide. The pockets on these are just below the waistband, giving you the best of both worlds-- nice pockets but also a clean side hem with no sticking out.5. The overall look- very classy, clean and neat.I should note that the medium length was just a tad too long for my 5' 5 frame in flats, but they are perfect with medium heels.Lee, please don't change anything. We love these pants and I will buying another pair in gray.",i have been looking for a nice pair of flattering wellfitting dressier pants for over a year ive returned multiple pairs and kept a few but ended up taking most to goodwill because they just didnt make me feel like i looked good in them i had almost given up and tried these as a last resort thinking id probably have to return them as well but no you cant pry these away from me these will be my go tos for the foreseeable future what i love the fit i bought lees for many years but quit buying them several years ago because the sizes were so inconsistent i could try on a  that fit like a  and another  that fit like a   they were also cut too tight for my liking not these no sir the  fit like a glove and made me look great i felt like a million dollars in them and they will go with anything the wash i threw them in the washer and then the dryer and they looked great no shrinking at all even though they are  cotton the fabric the cottonpolyesterelastane is a winner in my book very comfortable to wear and they look good as well the pockets i have returned several pairs of dressy pants because the pockets were on the side of the pant they stuck out and made my hips look really wide the pockets on these are just below the waistband giving you the best of both worlds nice pockets but also a clean side hem with no sticking out the overall look very classy clean and neati should note that the medium length was just a tad too long for my   frame in flats but they are perfect with medium heelslee please dont change anything we love these pants and i will buying another pair in gray,1

"The Lion Nardo Stretch Men's Dress Shirt has quickly become one of my favorites for formal and semi-formal events. The fabric of this shirt is simply outstanding—completely wrinkle-free and incredibly comfortable. It's hard to put into words just how pleasing the material is; I just wish more dress shirts were made like this.I recently wore this shirt under a sport coat to a wedding, and it was perfectly comfortable throughout the event. It wasn't overly warm, and the stretchy, soft fabric combined with its wrinkle-free nature made it an ideal choice for long wear. The shirt's fit and feel are fantastic, providing a modern, sleek look without compromising on comfort.The sizing is accurately aligned with American standards, which made it easy to select the right fit without any guesswork. My wife has even commented several times that I should order more of these shirts.While I find these shirts to be worth the investment, I do have a slight reservation about the price point, especially when compared to similar brand-name shirts. It can be a bit challenging to justify the cost when the prices are nearly the same. However, for the quality and comfort you get, these shirts are definitely worth considering.If you're looking for a dress shirt that combines exceptional comfort with elegant styling, the Lion Nardo Stretch Men's Dress Shirt is a superb choice.

"Ok, so this is just a bad product, not terrible or the worst ever or anything silly like that, just bad.I ordered a few pairs online because I know my size well, and I have never had significant issues with it after 42 years. No matter what, if I order a 30 x 30, I will get a pair that fits. For some brands, the fit might be a little different depending on the cut and stuff, but I have never gotten a pair that I could not wear.And then I met Amazon pants (trousers). The first set of 4 that I ordered in 30 x 30 in the indigo wash, all 4 at least were the same size which is good, but all 4 were far too small. After washing them the first time I tried them on, and both the waist and the length were off. Ok, that was my bad I figure, so I order 1 more pair this time in the 32 x 32 in the indigo wash, and 1 pair in the light wash also in 32 x 32, the next largest size in both dimensions as both dimensions were off. Seems reasonable.Got the new indigo wash pair in, and it was too big. Amazon alone of all the clothing companies I have ever owned seems to think the size I am should be I guess a 31 x 31, a size I so far have been unable to find. But low and behold the 32 x 32 is pretty good, the length is a bit off but the waist is good.Ok, that sucks, but they are not so bad that I can't wear them at all, the too-small ones were, but you can wear too-big. So keep them I did and I have now had them for exactly 43 days. I have worn them a bit, but as with most people, I think, I have other pants and have simply added them to the rotation. I also have not taken a hammer, beating stick, or anything else I can think of that should have affected durability this quickly. But they are now falling apart. I noticed something hard in my shoe yesterday, dumped it out and it turned out to be one of the rivets at the corners of the pockets. Checked both pairs, and both are missing at least 2. Also, there are some small frayed threads here and there, but I think that is mostly normal. Not something I would expect in the first two months of normal wear.Long story short, until someone purchases one of each color of these, be warned. The sizes may be somewhat off or perhaps ridiculously off of what you would think are normal sizes. At least with the indigo wash, I would recommend avoiding them as the sizes I think were tampered with by someone who should not have done so, but of course, I have a small sample size so just proceed with caution. The light wash seems to be mostly on track with what sizes actually are, though, of course, your results may vary. The quality on the other hand, again with the caveat of small sample size, but across two pairs from seemingly entirely different lines since the sizes are so different, to have quality issues on 2/2 units is exceptionally bad from a QC standpoint.I do appreciate Amazon stepping in with a lot of the basic items to give some competition, but I have had some pants that I am pretty sure came from third-world countries and such, especially in the 80s and 90s, and these are the worst I have ever owned. Save your money, and buy some Levi's that will actually make it through the first few years without falling apart on your body. This one may well be another failure that they have stopped caring about and are just trying to get costs back out of at this point.",ok so this is just a bad product not terrible or the worst ever or anything silly like that just badi ordered a few pairs online because i know my size well and i have never had significant issues with it after  years no matter what if i order a  x  i will get a pair that fits for some brands the fit might be a little different depending on the cut and stuff but i have never gotten a pair that i could not wearand then i met amazon pants trousers the first set of  that i ordered in  x  in the indigo wash all  at least were the same size which is good but all  were far too small after washing them the first time i tried them on and both the waist and the length were off ok that was my bad i figure so i order  more pair this time in the  x  in the indigo wash and  pair in the light wash also in  x  the next largest size in both dimensions as both dimensions were off seems reasonablegot the new indigo wash pair in and it was too big amazon alone of all the clothing companies i have ever owned seems to think the size i am should be i guess a  x  a size i so far have been unable to find but low and behold the  x  is pretty good the length is a bit off but the waist is goodok that sucks but they are not so bad that i cant wear them at all the toosmall ones were but you can wear toobig so keep them i did and i have now had them for exactly  days i have worn them a bit but as with most people i think i have other pants and have simply added them to the rotation i also have not taken a hammer beating stick or anything else i can think of that should have affected durability this quickly but they are now falling apart i noticed something hard in my shoe yesterday dumped it out and it turned out to be one of the rivets at the corners of the pockets checked both pairs and both are missing at least  also there are some small frayed threads here and there but i think that is mostly normal not something i would expect in the first two months of normal wearlong story short until someone purchases one of each color of these be warned the sizes may be somewhat off or perhaps ridiculously off of what you would think are normal sizes at least with the indigo wash i would recommend avoiding them as the sizes i think were tampered with by someone who should not have done so but of course i have a small sample size so just proceed with caution the light wash seems to be mostly on track with what sizes actually are though of course your results may vary the quality on the other hand again with the caveat of small sample size but across two pairs from seemingly entirely different lines since the sizes are so different to have quality issues on  units is exceptionally bad from a qc standpointi do appreciate amazon stepping in with a lot of the basic items to give some competition but i have had some pants that i am pretty sure came from thirdworld countries and such especially in the s and s and these are the worst i have ever owned save your money and buy some levis that will actually make it through the first few years without falling apart on your body this one may well be another failure that they have stopped caring about and are just trying to get costs back out of at this point,0

"Ordered these because, like many others here, I've got bigger thighs and a butt that are the limiting factor on the cuts of jeans I can wear.  I was specifically looking for jeans that can be appropriate for work and evenings.  I was a little hesitant after seeing some reviews here talking about the different material ratios and fits of the different colors.  I can confirm that this is accurate, but that's something that's pretty common when you're talking about jeans.  I did, however, expect that after looking at the Levi's website, seeing which washes had the 98/2 cotton/elastane ratio that those washes would fit the same.  That wasn't the case either though, and that's why I'm giving them 4 instead of 5 stars.The two colors I went with at first were the Midnight and the Timberwolf.  Both arrived with tags that marked them as ""stretch,"" which made me feel kind of weird.  They both do, in fact, have a bit of give to them, but you don't have to worry about them looking or feeling like you're putting on yoga pants.  They are roomy where they need to be while looking neat and thus can be used for work like I wanted.  However, I'd say that the Midnight wash was slightly larger than I was expecting while the Timberwolf were somewhat smaller, or rather, they just fit more snugly than the Midnight ones.  They're probably closer to what I expected the size to be, but it was odd that there was any difference for two pairs of pants supposedly in the same line (541) and made from the same material ""98% Cotton, 2% Elastane.""Regardless, they still both were cut the way I was looking for in terms of their general shape if not necessarily the specific fit on the waist.  Color-wise, the Midnight pair look exactly as pictured, while the Timberwolf are darker than what's pictured above.  The Levi's site has a more accurate color for them if you take a look there.  I prefer the color I received to what I saw above, but just know they will be darker.I also wanted a darker blue pair, but did not read good things about The Rich or Rigid Dragon here.  I was apprehensive, but decided to try The Rich to see for myself.  I was pleasantly surprised.  They're definitely a fit closer to the Timberwolf than the Midnight, which I guess is why some people said they're a bit more ""rigid"" but I've had those rough old Levi's in the past and these are certainly not anything close to that.  They also look like they're going to bleed, so I'm going to need to do the whole cold water + vinegar wash on them before I wear them.Overall these are good pants for anyone with a build that's got more meat in the butt/thigh region and struggling to find comfortable and stylish jeans in the straight or slim(mer) style.  Just be mindful that not all the washes are created equal in terms of the fit or feel and that there may be some color deviations from what you see above.",ordered these because like many others here ive got bigger thighs and a butt that are the limiting factor on the cuts of jeans i can wear  i was specifically looking for jeans that can be appropriate for work and evenings  i was a little hesitant after seeing some reviews here talking about the different material ratios and fits of the different colors  i can confirm that this is accurate but thats something thats pretty common when youre talking about jeans  i did however expect that after looking at the levis website seeing which washes had the  cottonelastane ratio that those washes would fit the same  that wasnt the case either though and thats why im giving them  instead of  starsthe two colors i went with at first were the midnight and the timberwolf  both arrived with tags that marked them as stretch which made me feel kind of weird  they both do in fact have a bit of give to them but you dont have to worry about them looking or feeling like youre putting on yoga pants  they are roomy where they need to be while looking neat and thus can be used for work like i wanted  however id say that the midnight wash was slightly larger than i was expecting while the timberwolf were somewhat smaller or rather they just fit more snugly than the midnight ones  theyre probably closer to what i expected the size to be but it was odd that there was any difference for two pairs of pants supposedly in the same line  and made from the same material  cotton  elastaneregardless they still both were cut the way i was looking for in terms of their general shape if not necessarily the specific fit on the waist  colorwise the midnight pair look exactly as pictured while the timberwolf are darker than whats pictured above  the levis site has a more accurate color for them if you take a look there  i prefer the color i received to what i saw above but just know they will be darkeri also wanted a darker blue pair but did not read good things about the rich or rigid dragon here  i was apprehensive but decided to try the rich to see for myself  i was pleasantly surprised  theyre definitely a fit closer to the timberwolf than the midnight which i guess is why some people said theyre a bit more rigid but ive had those rough old levis in the past and these are certainly not anything close to that  they also look like theyre going to bleed so im going to need to do the whole cold water  vinegar wash on them before i wear themoverall these are good pants for anyone with a build thats got more meat in the buttthigh region and struggling to find comfortable and stylish jeans in the straight or slimmer style  just be mindful that not all the washes are created equal in terms of the fit or feel and that there may be some color deviations from what you see above,1
"I absolutely love the Dickie's heavyweight tee shirts for men. I buy them for my husband frequently.  I think the first one I ever bought was for our 2nd wedding anniversary, because the traditional gift is cotton (yes we are dorks and try to do that every year with some kind of applicable gift).  It was a light brown color.  We will be celebrating our 7th anniversary in a couple of months, and that tee shirt after 5 years and a million washes is still in top condition - no holes, no rips, no fading of the color, no loose stitches. These are very high quality heavy material tee shirts (i.e., not see through or so thin that you can see chest hair or nips), and I am told very comfortable.

"I’m a fan of Under Armour compression shorts in general, I have several pair that I bought locally through a sporting goods store. They provide good overall compression and support without a jockstrap. I’m not sure these are up to the same quality standard as previous purchases because the material feels lighter and the stitching doesn’t appear to be holding up as well as the others after wearing and washing these maybe 10 times or so. The white fabric is also more sheer than black, but I bought white because it was in stock at the time I needed them. There is a side pocket for my phone, and it works fine, but I usually just slip my phone in my shorts that I wear over the compression shorts so I can get to it easily.",i’m a fan of under armour compression shorts in general i have several pair that i bought locally through a sporting goods store they provide good overall compression and support without a jockstrap i’m not sure these are up to the same quality standard as previous purchases because the material feels lighter and the stitching doesn’t appear to be holding up as well as the others after wearing and washing these maybe  times or so the white fabric is also more sheer than black but i bought white because it was in stock at the time i needed them there is a side pocket for my phone and it works fine but i usually just slip my phone in my shorts that i wear over the compression shorts so i can get to it easily,1

"I'm a size 30 in pants and ordered the small. This fit well, but I think the cut of the underwear is designed for bigger guys.My pros: They survived my washer, which has a running tally of how many of my clothes it has shredded. So the seams are definitely durable. I haven't had any problems with sweat (but it is also November). I've worn these to the gym and they do just fine. The fabric content doesn't vary across colors, and is mostly cotton. They're solid underwear.My cons: The waistband is too high up, which makes me fold down the band for comfort (might just be me though). The legs are rather tight and sometimes bunch up on my thighs.  This is my first pair of boxer briefs though, I've been wearing Nautica briefs and David Archy trunks and been satisfied with those. It fits kinda weird on my butt, not sure how to describe it but it's not the most comfortable, like I'm wearing a leotard or something.  It does hold everything in place, though.Overall, decent product but not my favorite underwear for me, probably fits better on bigger guys. I may leave these in the back of my drawer.

"This is a no frills rain coat that does what it should: keep the rain off. It's made of nylon-poly fabric with a rubber-like coating. It has a rain proof zipper along with a zipper-covering flap that fastens with metal snaps. The snaps are good quality that are easy to use and look like they'll last. There's a good size hood with a drawstring. There are two 6.5 by 7.5 pockets with flaps but no snaps. I'm 5' 9 and a medium fits me well. There is enough room for a bulky hoodie sweater.Overall, I gave this a rating of 4 stars. It didn't get the fifth star for several reasons. First of all, there are no vents, not in the arm pits, not along the upper back. The fabric is non breathing, so in warmer weather you're likely to get a bit sweaty if the coat's fully zipped. The pockets are simple patch pockets with no access to inside pockets. If you're in the rain digging for keys in your pants pockets you have to unzip or pull the coat up.  There are no cord locks on the hood drawstring. If you want to tighten the hood opening you'll have to tie a knot and then untie it when you want out of the coat. The zipper does not have the option to partially open from the bottom. If you have a longer stride you may find the zipped coat a bit constraining due to coat's length. To be fair, you could not use the zipper and depend on the top three or four snaps.Overall I like this raincoat.

"After booking a trip out of state, I realized I didn't have shoes that could withstand several day's worth of walking.I'm so thankful I found this pair. Not only are they cute, stylish, and pair well with my outfits, they're also extremely comfortable, supportive, and lightweight. I've tried other brands of shoes that just feel heavy and clunky on my feet. These are the complete opposite of that- it's like walking on clouds!I managed to walk about 30 miles in a 3 day timespan with these shoes: climbing stairs, running through subways, walking along cobblestone paths, through wet grassy areas, and more. Never once did my feet, knees, or back ache. Also, the tongue of the shoe is attached, so no fumbling around with ensuring it stayed in place was a huge plus for me. If anything, this feature makes the shoe easy to slip off and on.I've also since worn these to work where I'm on my feet about 10 hours each day, walking, kneeling, etc. and no discomfort whatsoever. I've received many compliments on them everywhere I go!Additionally, I've handwashed my pair about 2 times now and each time they look brand new again.I don't often leave reviews on anything, but these were worthy of it.

"These pants are a great fit for my tall, slender boys. The waist is slightly smaller than average for UA pants, which is great because they don’t have to cinch them in near as far. I got them on sale which made them a great value for what I paid. The material is a good weight, not too hot but shouldn’t rip easily. They have fully functional pockets the back one is a standard line style pocket, but the side pockets are full zip which is fantastic for on the go people. They even offer these in tall, which is rare. My 6’3” son who weighs 150 pounds fit beautifully into a medium tall.

"The flexible waistband is wonderful.  It makes the pants super comfortable.  I like the fabric really well too.  The pants look good and feel good.  The only improvements that can be made are that the front pockets are not as deep as I would like and the only thing holding the front closed is one button.  I usually put a lot of stuff in my front pockets, including my wallet and I like the pockets to be a bit deeper.  The one button holding the front together seems like it can pop off at any time.  I would like to see both a button and a hook fastener in the front.  The button has not popped off yet, but I only wore the pants one time.  If the pockets were deeper and if the front had a double system of closure, then this would be a five-star item.  Those things aside, I will buy them again.",the flexible waistband is wonderful  it makes the pants super comfortable  i like the fabric really well too  the pants look good and feel good  the only improvements that can be made are that the front pockets are not as deep as i would like and the only thing holding the front closed is one button  i usually put a lot of stuff in my front pockets including my wallet and i like the pockets to be a bit deeper  the one button holding the front together seems like it can pop off at any time  i would like to see both a button and a hook fastener in the front  the button has not popped off yet but i only wore the pants one time  if the pockets were deeper and if the front had a double system of closure then this would be a fivestar item  those things aside i will buy them again,1

"I wanted a classic, rugged-looking shoe and, from the looks of it, these Dockers Overtones looked to be perfect. However, these shoes were a little too heavy for my liking so I had to send them back. I'm all about the comfort of my shoes, so these just didn't do the trick. This led me to the Rockport Eureka Walking Shoes. Let me tell you that they were exactly what I was looking for in a pair of shoes. The Rockports are not only comfortable, but they look great, too! The shoe has more than 28,000 reviews, all with many outstanding ratings. I found a great way to test them out to determine their comfort, and that's on the treadmill.UPDATE: Unfortunately, I am returning the shoes. My initial thoughts on the shoes was a bit premature. As others have mentioned, the tongue on the left shoe is too short, resulting in the corner of the tongue digging into my ankle. I've given enough time (walking on a treadmill for miles) to break them in to see if that would correct the problem. Also, I was in a fast food restaurant while they were mopping the floor, and I walked outside the wet area where there was simply a lightly damp area, and I slide as thought I was on a skating rink. I love the style and fit of the shoe until I start walking. It appears there may be a quality control problem. I've read numerous reviews about the issue and yet it continues to be a problem. I changing my rating from a 5 to a 3. I hope the company will correct the issue, because the shoe is a great shoe! The shoes were made in India. I do believe that my problem is not everyone's problem, and every shoe manufactured does not have this problem, therefore, I am still recommending the shoe with a 3 rating.",i wanted a classic ruggedlooking shoe and from the looks of it these dockers overtones looked to be perfect however these shoes were a little too heavy for my liking so i had to send them back im all about the comfort of my shoes so these just didnt do the trick this led me to the rockport eureka walking shoes let me tell you that they were exactly what i was looking for in a pair of shoes the rockports are not only comfortable but they look great too the shoe has more than  reviews all with many outstanding ratings i found a great way to test them out to determine their comfort and thats on the treadmillupdate unfortunately i am returning the shoes my initial thoughts on the shoes was a bit premature as others have mentioned the tongue on the left shoe is too short resulting in the corner of the tongue digging into my ankle ive given enough time walking on a treadmill for miles to break them in to see if that would correct the problem also i was in a fast food restaurant while they were mopping the floor and i walked outside the wet area where there was simply a lightly damp area and i slide as thought i was on a skating rink i love the style and fit of the shoe until i start walking it appears there may be a quality control problem ive read numerous reviews about the issue and yet it continues to be a problem i changing my rating from a  to a  i hope the company will correct the issue because the shoe is a great shoe the shoes were made in india i do believe that my problem is not everyones problem and every shoe manufactured does not have this problem therefore i am still recommending the shoe with a  rating,1

"I always start out saying that measuring tape doesnt lie.This brand is Lee. Like most brands, they have their own size chart. Also this particular style won't flatter all figures... Especially if you choose a size too small. So measure yourself, and look at the sizing guide. Theres a bit of a trick to it (not really).I like:1.The material of these jeans is soft and has some stretch to it but its not suffocating in warmer weather.2. The high waist is perfect height.3. They give the perfect silouhette (like wide legs pants/jeans circa 1930s-1950s) *as long as you get the correct size for YOUR measurements.*My height and weight cannot help you decide your own size. Why? You might ask.I AM 5'4. My measurements taken with a seamstress tape at various times of the year:Fullest part of bust with bra on: 35-37Waist at navel: 25-27Hips:35-37My legs and arms are a bit lengthy and my shoulders are broad. I have to buy larger shirts just because of my shoulders for some brands.Someone with the same height and and weight as myself might have a larger bust, a smaller waist and hips than mine. And they would need a smaller size of these jeans and wear larger size shirts.Or if a person is a pear figure they might need a larger size while their shirt size would likely ve smaller than mine.  Even if we weigh the same we need different sizes. Get it? Good.I purchased the 2 short. Why?1. Im 5'4.2. My waist measures 26 most of the time.3. My hips measure 37 most of the time.Usually when jeans are sized they shouldnt be the exact same measurement as the body. They should provide an extra inch or so to accomodate for tucking in your shirt a d fitting over undergarments.I had a suspicion that Lee would factor that into the sizes... They did.The jeans add 1.5 inches to accomodate and they call it size 2 (i guess for vanity's sake?). While the EU size us 26 (an actual size 6 according to classic garment making). They are stretchy so the fit is a little more forgiving than a non stretch alternative. However these jeans are not the same as skinny jeans. Youre not supposed to squeeze into them.For that perfect silhouette, you really must pay atrention to your waist AND hip measurements. If the difference between your waist and hips is greater than 15 i.e. You're a wasp waist hourglass (i kind of envy you guys), or a wasp waist pear: you want to make sure these are the right fit for your hips first.  Thet should give that extra 1-1.5 according to the chart, or even get a size up. After you get them you could take them to a tailor to custom fit the waist (if you got a perfect hip size) and the hip area to perfection (thats where the larger size comes in) and these would look SUPER AMAZING on you.A banana figure may need a small adjustment at the waist or hips. They could possibly size down if their hips and waist have a very small difference since the material stretches.If you have an apple or inverted triangle figure, you should pay the most attention to your waist size. If necessary, you can also have the hips adjusted to improve the line if your silhouette.Final thoughts: i am happy that I can find wide leg jeans easier now. Before, i would just make do with boot cut jeans (i like those a lot too). I had to wait a while for them to come back in style (jeans at least). However, i dont think it should be like this. Jeans arent supposed ti be like this! Different jeans flatter different figures in various ways. For instance an inverted triangle figure might have a more striking silhouette in a set of jeans with a harem pant fit,  or a Monroe style jean. Both would balance out the shoulder line quite well. An apple body would probably rock some bell bottoms like a champ by highlighting slender thighs and having the bell to balance their upper body.Each figure can create the perfect silhouette for their personality and figure. So... Look at all the various jean styles available and choose whats best for YOUR body and personality.After all comfortable clothes that compliment our figures are always the best!",i always start out saying that measuring tape doesnt liethis brand is lee like most brands they have their own size chart also this particular style wont flatter all figures especially if you choose a size too small so measure yourself and look at the sizing guide theres a bit of a trick to it not reallyi likethe material of these jeans is soft and has some stretch to it but its not suffocating in warmer weather the high waist is perfect height they give the perfect silouhette like wide legs pantsjeans circa ss as long as you get the correct size for your measurementsmy height and weight cannot help you decide your own size why you might aski am  my measurements taken with a seamstress tape at various times of the yearfullest part of bust with bra on waist at navel hipsmy legs and arms are a bit lengthy and my shoulders are broad i have to buy larger shirts just because of my shoulders for some brandssomeone with the same height and and weight as myself might have a larger bust a smaller waist and hips than mine and they would need a smaller size of these jeans and wear larger size shirtsor if a person is a pear figure they might need a larger size while their shirt size would likely ve smaller than mine  even if we weigh the same we need different sizes get it goodi purchased the  short why im  my waist measures  most of the time my hips measure  most of the timeusually when jeans are sized they shouldnt be the exact same measurement as the body they should provide an extra inch or so to accomodate for tucking in your shirt a d fitting over undergarmentsi had a suspicion that lee would factor that into the sizes they didthe jeans add  inches to accomodate and they call it size  i guess for vanitys sake while the eu size us  an actual size  according to classic garment making they are stretchy so the fit is a little more forgiving than a non stretch alternative however these jeans are not the same as skinny jeans youre not supposed to squeeze into themfor that perfect silhouette you really must pay atrention to your waist and hip measurements if the difference between your waist and hips is greater than  ie youre a wasp waist hourglass i kind of envy you guys or a wasp waist pear you want to make sure these are the right fit for your hips first  thet should give that extra  according to the chart or even get a size up after you get them you could take them to a tailor to custom fit the waist if you got a perfect hip size and the hip area to perfection thats where the larger size comes in and these would look super amazing on youa banana figure may need a small adjustment at the waist or hips they could possibly size down if their hips and waist have a very small difference since the material stretchesif you have an apple or inverted triangle figure you should pay the most attention to your waist size if necessary you can also have the hips adjusted to improve the line if your silhouettefinal thoughts i am happy that i can find wide leg jeans easier now before i would just make do with boot cut jeans i like those a lot too i had to wait a while for them to come back in style jeans at least however i dont think it should be like this jeans arent supposed ti be like this different jeans flatter different figures in various ways for instance an inverted triangle figure might have a more striking silhouette in a set of jeans with a harem pant fit  or a monroe style jean both would balance out the shoulder line quite well an apple body would probably rock some bell bottoms like a champ by highlighting slender thighs and having the bell to balance their upper bodyeach figure can create the perfect silhouette for their personality and figure so look at all the various jean styles available and choose whats best for your body and personalityafter all comfortable clothes that compliment our figures are always the best,1

The lace detailing adds a lovely touch of elegance that makes it perfect for both casual outings and more polished business settings.The fit is true to size and incredibly comfortable.

"Levi's 505 jeans are a classic choice for men that have been popular for decades. Here's a review covering key aspects:Fit: The 505 jeans are known for their straight leg cut, which is neither too slim nor too loose. This makes them versatile and suitable for various body types. They provide a comfortable fit without feeling overly baggy or constricting.Comfort: Levi's is renowned for using high-quality denim that is durable yet comfortable. The 505 jeans typically have a bit of stretch, which adds to their comfort level, especially for daily wear or activities that require some movement.Durability: One of the standout features of Levi's jeans, including the 505 model, is their durability. The denim is sturdy and holds up well over time, even with regular washing and wear. This makes them a reliable choice for long-term use.Style: While the 505 jeans are known for their classic, timeless style, Levi's also offers them in various washes and finishes to suit different preferences. Whether you prefer a faded, worn-in look or a darker, more polished appearance, you can likely find a 505 style that fits your style.Value: Levi's jeans, including the 505, are typically priced competitively considering their quality and reputation. While they may be slightly more expensive than budget jeans, many customers find that the durability and comfort justify the cost.Sizing: It's worth noting that Levi's sizing can vary slightly between different batches or styles. Some customers may find that they need to size up or down compared to their usual size, so it's advisable to check the sizing guide or try on the jeans if possible before purchasing.Overall, Levi's 505 jeans are a solid choice for men seeking a classic, comfortable, and durable pair of jeans that can withstand everyday wear and various activities. Their timeless style and reliable quality have made them a staple in many men's wardrobes for years.",levis  jeans are a classic choice for men that have been popular for decades heres a review covering key aspectsfit the  jeans are known for their straight leg cut which is neither too slim nor too loose this makes them versatile and suitable for various body types they provide a comfortable fit without feeling overly baggy or constrictingcomfort levis is renowned for using highquality denim that is durable yet comfortable the  jeans typically have a bit of stretch which adds to their comfort level especially for daily wear or activities that require some movementdurability one of the standout features of levis jeans including the  model is their durability the denim is sturdy and holds up well over time even with regular washing and wear this makes them a reliable choice for longterm usestyle while the  jeans are known for their classic timeless style levis also offers them in various washes and finishes to suit different preferences whether you prefer a faded wornin look or a darker more polished appearance you can likely find a  style that fits your stylevalue levis jeans including the  are typically priced competitively considering their quality and reputation while they may be slightly more expensive than budget jeans many customers find that the durability and comfort justify the costsizing its worth noting that levis sizing can vary slightly between different batches or styles some customers may find that they need to size up or down compared to their usual size so its advisable to check the sizing guide or try on the jeans if possible before purchasingoverall levis  jeans are a solid choice for men seeking a classic comfortable and durable pair of jeans that can withstand everyday wear and various activities their timeless style and reliable quality have made them a staple in many mens wardrobes for years,1

"I have just gotten back from my trip to Japan in winter.  In my time there I am amazed by how often I used this jacket and how wonderful it was.First off it is surprisingly warm for the size.  I have a large REI travel jacket that is waterproof.  I noticed that when wearing that travel jacket I was cold!  I thought that the warmth of the travel jacket would have been equivalent to this puffer jacket, and I was very wrong.  It is very warm for it's size.It is very packable.  I often times packed it in the little duffle pouch, and pulled it out at evenings when it became cold.  It made all the difference, and kept me nice and warm.  It is part of a layering system and worked very well (Heat tech top and botton, jeans, a sweater, scarf, hat, and this puffer jacket).It was not exactly trendy, but did not look out of place in Tokyo.  Many many puffer jackets were on the streets, and it blended right in.  It was probably the single most useful purchase I made for the trip.  I wholly recommend this jacket.",i have just gotten back from my trip to japan in winter  in my time there i am amazed by how often i used this jacket and how wonderful it wasfirst off it is surprisingly warm for the size  i have a large rei travel jacket that is waterproof  i noticed that when wearing that travel jacket i was cold  i thought that the warmth of the travel jacket would have been equivalent to this puffer jacket and i was very wrong  it is very warm for its sizeit is very packable  i often times packed it in the little duffle pouch and pulled it out at evenings when it became cold  it made all the difference and kept me nice and warm  it is part of a layering system and worked very well heat tech top and botton jeans a sweater scarf hat and this puffer jacketit was not exactly trendy but did not look out of place in tokyo  many many puffer jackets were on the streets and it blended right in  it was probably the single most useful purchase i made for the trip  i wholly recommend this jacket,1

The zipper works, even for a bigger guy. The hood is easily removed if you don't like a hood. All zippers and velcro seem to hold up well.The only bad is where the velcro is placed on the coat. It causes the sleeve yo get caught on the velcro material and pulls at the outer shell.Value for the money spent is still very high.

The material in these jackets starts to rub and large amounts of pilling occur within hours of wearing. I don't know what material it's actually made of but even pure polyester doesn't wear as badly as the material in these coats.A buddy of mine had one that was several years old You could see how terrible it looked after a few years of wearing it.I'll be giving these to my 15 year old cousin because he enjoys the style and isn't going to be wearing these in any kind of work or professional setting. Definitely would not be appropriate at the office or anywhere professional...the appearance after just a few wears makes these more like a barn coat only.I mean some people might not notice it but if you're on a date or you're sitting or standing close to someone it becomes obvious the quality of the materials that the jacket is made out of.Which is weird because the construction and the sewing and the design are actually quite nice. There's two interior pockets with lots of space and two exterior pockets and the sewing and stitching are all great It's just the material is trash..I'm sorry to give such a bad review but for this price I expected better and these are essentially a waste of money because they only look good the very first time you wear them.Also not to mention they were not insulating at all and provide very little warmth in the winter.And I mean I'm sorry to give a negative review but I literally wasted over $100 on these coats and by the time I figured out how bad they were it was too late to return them.,the material in these jackets starts to rub and large amounts of pilling occur within hours of wearing i dont know what material its actually made of but even pure polyester doesnt wear as badly as the material in these coatsa buddy of mine had one that was several years old you could see how terrible it looked after a few years of wearing itill be giving these to my  year old cousin because he enjoys the style and isnt going to be wearing these in any kind of work or professional setting definitely would not be appropriate at the office or anywhere professionalthe appearance after just a few wears makes these more like a barn coat onlyi mean some people might not notice it but if youre on a date or youre sitting or standing close to someone it becomes obvious the quality of the materials that the jacket is made out ofwhich is weird because the construction and the sewing and the design are actually quite nice theres two interior pockets with lots of space and two exterior pockets and the sewing and stitching are all great its just the material is trashim sorry to give such a bad review but for this price i expected better and these are essentially a waste of money because they only look good the very first time you wear themalso not to mention they were not insulating at all and provide very little warmth in the winterand i mean im sorry to give a negative review but i literally wasted over  on these coats and by the time i figured out how bad they were it was too late to return them,0

"I ordered this polo to use both as a shirt for the shooting range as well as a hiking shirt on the days I expect it to be hot and humid where I want a shirt that wicks moisture and dries quickly.This polo looks and feels great and is lightweight, but not see through when wearing it.  It wicks and breathes well, dries quickly, and feels comfortable on the skin. Whet it does get wet, before it dries, it does not stretch out like cotton fabrics do. I don’t notice any seams while wearing it and it has just the right amount of stretch.For reference, I am 5’8”, 150 lbs., with a 38-inch chest and I ordered the Medium. It fits just right, and I think a Small would have been too tight; the medium size polo is 28-inches from the seam on the back of the neck just below the collar down to the hem, and 25.5-inches from the front of the neck down to the hem.  The length of the sleeve from under the armpit to the cuff is 2.5-inches, and the length of the sleeve from the seam at the top of the shoulder to the cuff is 8-inches.It's just long enough to tuck-in if I wish, but if I want to wear it causal with my Carhartt’s untucked or with hiking pants, it looks great with just the right amount of length. The collar is not too stiff or too floppy and holds its shape well.The only nitpick that I have is that the buttons have made an imprint on the back of the shirt, but fortunately my long hair covers that up.

"These are Gaglg running trunks. These are great gym trunks or running trunks that have a draw string. You get a choice of 2 colors. Cost is $26.

Waist band is stretchable. They have an inseam of about 16 inches which is just right.

My husband is a true Big and tall at 6‚Äô5‚Äù and over 300, so to find his size in anything is a challenge and we were thrilled to find these in multiple colors and styles!  These were the perfect length and waist size. He loved the feel of the material and comfortable (expandable) waistband. But the The fit was extremely unflattering. The crotch was extremely billowy with the crotch falling lower than normal (to the upper mid-thigh).  It would be perfect if you‚Äôre shaped like a top like Tweedle Dee. It was very odd. When he sat down it looked like they just expanded. We had no choice but to return it. [NOTE:  We also bought the flat fit version, to see if that would make a difference‚Ä¶ and it did not.

"Material doesn't look (shinny) cheap nor flimsy - sturdy and fine looking. Tayloring is also good and fits as designed (slim). Only issue is that the sleeves are way too long in proportion: should someone's arms are actually long enough to fit the sleeves, they must be at least 6' tall (and skinny for the sleeves which also run on the tight side), which would then make the overall suit look short. It cost me $26 to have it shortened (and pressed), but still a good buy for this price and quality.",material doesnt look shinny cheap nor flimsy  sturdy and fine looking tayloring is also good and fits as designed slim only issue is that the sleeves are way too long in proportion should someones arms are actually long enough to fit the sleeves they must be at least  tall and skinny for the sleeves which also run on the tight side which would then make the overall suit look short it cost me  to have it shortened and pressed but still a good buy for this price and quality,1

I love these jeans. They fit really well and are very comfortable. I do think they are slightly bigger than the marked size. The only issue I have with these jeans is they wear out fairly quickly. Every pair of Levi’s I’ve had tend to wear out and get a hole between the zipper and where the legs meet. It isn’t from stretching like it gets pulled but it’s a wear hole and I only have this issue with Levi’s. I can get maybe 6 months out of them and that’s only wearing them after work and on weekends.,i love these jeans they fit really well and are very comfortable i do think they are slightly bigger than the marked size the only issue i have with these jeans is they wear out fairly quickly every pair of levi’s i’ve had tend to wear out and get a hole between the zipper and where the legs meet it isn’t from stretching like it gets pulled but it’s a wear hole and i only have this issue with levi’s i can get maybe  months out of them and that’s only wearing them after work and on weekends,1

My cousin was wearing this same shoe at my Dad's 100th birthday party. He told me they were Skechers. When I got home I looked them up on Amazon and ordered a pair. It's hard to find a good looking pair of wide size 13 shoes. The shoes are really nice looking and one of the most comfortable pair of shoes I have ever owned because I suffer from a number of foot ailments caused by my service in THE USMC. Because of injuries I suffered I have severe neuropathy from the neck down so these shoes I can just step into and go. That way I don't need my wife or daughter to tie my shoes anymore. Great in the ice and snow in northern Indiana while it's easy to maintain the shoes appearance. Definitely going to buy another similar designed Skechers shoe.,my cousin was wearing this same shoe at my dads th birthday party he told me they were skechers when i got home i looked them up on amazon and ordered a pair its hard to find a good looking pair of wide size  shoes the shoes are really nice looking and one of the most comfortable pair of shoes i have ever owned because i suffer from a number of foot ailments caused by my service in the usmc because of injuries i suffered i have severe neuropathy from the neck down so these shoes i can just step into and go that way i dont need my wife or daughter to tie my shoes anymore great in the ice and snow in northern indiana while its easy to maintain the shoes appearance definitely going to buy another similar designed skechers shoe,1

"These are great looking and fitting shorts. The length is perfect in that they hit just above the kneecap. I feel like a gangbanger wearing shorts that come below my knee and those kinds of shorts just aren't age appropriate for over 60 (for me anyway). I like that these have the amount of stretch in the waistband. It allows me to wear a size down from what I need in shorts with no stretch. These are size 36 and fit perfectly. The belt loops are an added feature in these types of shorts over just those with a string to tie. I'm 5'9 and 189 pounds and my stomach is bigger than my hips, so a belt is essential to keep them up. It hard to get the string tie tight enough to stay up and still be comfortable in a seated position. Good quality, nice deep pockets. I could have done without the front pockets having zippers, but that is not a deal breaker. Same with not having two pockets on the rear. I have carried my wallet in my left back pocket for years and I keep reaching around to get it out. Otherwise, these are great summer shorts, and I have bought another pair in a different color.",these are great looking and fitting shorts the length is perfect in that they hit just above the kneecap i feel like a gangbanger wearing shorts that come below my knee and those kinds of shorts just arent age appropriate for over  for me anyway i like that these have the amount of stretch in the waistband it allows me to wear a size down from what i need in shorts with no stretch these are size  and fit perfectly the belt loops are an added feature in these types of shorts over just those with a string to tie im  and  pounds and my stomach is bigger than my hips so a belt is essential to keep them up it hard to get the string tie tight enough to stay up and still be comfortable in a seated position good quality nice deep pockets i could have done without the front pockets having zippers but that is not a deal breaker same with not having two pockets on the rear i have carried my wallet in my left back pocket for years and i keep reaching around to get it out otherwise these are great summer shorts and i have bought another pair in a different color,1

"I purchased three pairs of these for a cruise to the Bahamas. The fit is the best thing about these linen blend pants. In comparison to other brands I have purchased, these have a tapered leg and less voluminous overall fit. Are these skinny fit? No...so don't misunderstand. I never understand why people expect a beach pant to be skinny, when the point is to wear a loose, cool pant for the hot weather? I bought white, navy and beige and all have a nice weight to the fabric. They're not flimsy feeling or see-thru like some others I tried. As other reviewers have stated, the beige is slightly yellowish and the navy is slightly lighter than navy. The color difference isn't a deal breaker for me, so I kept all three. The pockets are patch pockets, which give them a casual vibe. I like the dressier look of non-patch pockets on another brand I bought at the same time, but this is the only brand I've found that's more fitted. After washing the pants in gentle, cool water and line drying, I didn't notice any shrinkage. For reference, I wear a 32x32 jean and size 32 fit perfectly in length and waist. The only negative about these pants involves the beige color pant. I experienced the same problem as another reviewer. When the beige pant was washed, it looked like the color was bleached out of the fabric over a large area. I thought I overused the oxyclean when I tried to remove some stains from the trip. However, after drying, the color was perfectly normal over the entire pant with no problems. I definitely recommend these pants.",i purchased three pairs of these for a cruise to the bahamas the fit is the best thing about these linen blend pants in comparison to other brands i have purchased these have a tapered leg and less voluminous overall fit are these skinny fit noso dont misunderstand i never understand why people expect a beach pant to be skinny when the point is to wear a loose cool pant for the hot weather i bought white navy and beige and all have a nice weight to the fabric theyre not flimsy feeling or seethru like some others i tried as other reviewers have stated the beige is slightly yellowish and the navy is slightly lighter than navy the color difference isnt a deal breaker for me so i kept all three the pockets are patch pockets which give them a casual vibe i like the dressier look of nonpatch pockets on another brand i bought at the same time but this is the only brand ive found thats more fitted after washing the pants in gentle cool water and line drying i didnt notice any shrinkage for reference i wear a x jean and size  fit perfectly in length and waist the only negative about these pants involves the beige color pant i experienced the same problem as another reviewer when the beige pant was washed it looked like the color was bleached out of the fabric over a large area i thought i overused the oxyclean when i tried to remove some stains from the trip however after drying the color was perfectly normal over the entire pant with no problems i definitely recommend these pants,1

"These shorts seem to be well made (only warn them once) but are surprisingly soft and are very comfortable. The material is is light weight and doesn't hold excess moisture. They have large pockets, which I like. I am 5'-8.5 tall, have a 47 waist (currently working on getting that number lower) and the XXL size fits pretty well. The waist is slightly on the loose side for my preference but not sure I could drop to a XL. The shorts do have a drawstring but I didn't need to tie it while at the gym. The inseam length of these shorts is 10, per the description, which comes to about the middle of my kneecap when standing. I would prefer them to sit just above my kneecap and believe 7-8 inseam length in these would fit about right. However, I can't fault these shorts for my body size since the dimensions are well described.

"I love the look and feel but as far as durability/ruggedness this is not a jacket you want to wear for working in rough dirty environments, the jacket just seems too nice and delicate. For something more suited for a harsh outdoor work environment I would go with a more durable option from a company like Carhart, the downside being it will cost 3-4 times as much. This is a good jacket for walking around in public and looking good on chilly days which is what I wanted. The arm length was very short on the medium I originally ordered.  I'm 5' 8 with medium build and when I bent my arms the sleaves road up to my elbows. I ordered a large and it fits a lot better. I wear it daily now for running errands around town or doing small task outside. This jacket is just not thick enough on its own to stay warm for long in hash winter weather. It was 34 degrees today and a little windy and I could feel the cold seeping through for the short time I was outside. Definitely would want to add another layer underneath it if you plan on being outside on a cold winter day for more than an hour.

"I purchased this coat based on the raving reviews, but it did not meet my expectations that they set. I find it hard to believe this coat would be warm enough to wear skiing or shoveling snow in Northern Michigan. I guess I'll find out in the next 36 hours as we are expecting at least 7-10 of snow and near 0° temps. The shell is rugged and feels like it could withstand some abuse. The liner, which is not removable, is a furry fleece that is very soft to the touch. The zippers are plastic, so you shouldn't have to worry about them freezing up, and the coat has multiple,  functioning pockets. I don't see the need for multiple embroidered logos, but it is what it is. For the price, it would seem to be a reasonable purchase. Sizing is accurate and color is uniform. As for functionality; time will tell. Overall it's an excellent purchase at the sale price (I paid about $35).

"I really like these shoes.  My only thought about them is that they make your feet slide forward after time.  My feet slide forward because it has a wedge design to them, very much like other shoes.  These just have more of that wedge grade.  I have others like this, so I can feel that my feet have moved forward because my toes start to feel scrunched up.It's not that big of a deal, but a deal enough to remove one star.  Otherwise, it would have gotten 5.The shoes themselves are comfortable and they do have a really good grip.  So much so that they keep a layer of snow on the soles when walking through it. lolThey are water-repellant. I have not soaked them to find out, but I have splashed water on them by accident. Of course, the snow that Colorado has received has put the repellant part to the test, and the shoes win every time, as the insides are always dry.",i really like these shoes  my only thought about them is that they make your feet slide forward after time  my feet slide forward because it has a wedge design to them very much like other shoes  these just have more of that wedge grade  i have others like this so i can feel that my feet have moved forward because my toes start to feel scrunched upits not that big of a deal but a deal enough to remove one star  otherwise it would have gotten the shoes themselves are comfortable and they do have a really good grip  so much so that they keep a layer of snow on the soles when walking through it lolthey are waterrepellant i have not soaked them to find out but i have splashed water on them by accident of course the snow that colorado has received has put the repellant part to the test and the shoes win every time as the insides are always dry,1

"I love the pockets placement, the ease of them sliding on, and the material is soft as butter. But,,, it attracts everything. I have a long haired cat, and as soon as I took them off, I noticed how it jumped on that material really fast. That’s an issue. Sooo here is the stats for ordering. I’m 5’8” weight 198 and I ordered a L.  BUT, once I got them on, they were pulling and those nasty wrinkles showed up. That me…not the pants. I’d order these in every color IF…..I didn’t have a cat, could get a slimmer leg,  and this weight would disappear. Autoimmune diseases. So back they go. I’ll keep trying until I find that just right pair of pocketed, flare legs, any color combinations, and that allusive fit…theses people, are a good start.",i love the pockets placement the ease of them sliding on and the material is soft as butter but it attracts everything i have a long haired cat and as soon as i took them off i noticed how it jumped on that material really fast that’s an issue sooo here is the stats for ordering i’m ’” weight  and i ordered a l  but once i got them on they were pulling and those nasty wrinkles showed up that me…not the pants i’d order these in every color if…i didn’t have a cat could get a slimmer leg  and this weight would disappear autoimmune diseases so back they go i’ll keep trying until i find that just right pair of pocketed flare legs any color combinations and that allusive fit…theses people are a good start,1

"These are a nice, slim fit. My son is 12 and very lean and tall. It’s impossible to find sweats that don’t look baggy on him. This brand and style seems to work. I wish they were slightly longer as they do shrink after uses in the dryer, but they are much softer when they go through the dryer.",these are a nice slim fit my son is  and very lean and tall it’s impossible to find sweats that don’t look baggy on him this brand and style seems to work i wish they were slightly longer as they do shrink after uses in the dryer but they are much softer when they go through the dryer,1

"For reference I'm 5'8 and pear-shaped. My weight fluctuates between 174 - 179 lbs, waist 34in and hips 42in. I followed the size chart and went with a size 18. First impressions: the jeans are very soft, stretchy, and comfortable. Fabric feels durable not flimsy. The jeans were a tad too long for flats but would be fine with a platform/wedge/heel. Comfortable fit in the thighs and overall flattering shape. However, the waist-hip area was too big, and the pockets weren't centered on my butt so that looked a bit off. I'm thinking of returning these and ordering a smaller size, but I'm not sure which size to get because the size chart was not accurate for me.",for reference im  and pearshaped my weight fluctuates between    lbs waist in and hips in i followed the size chart and went with a size  first impressions the jeans are very soft stretchy and comfortable fabric feels durable not flimsy the jeans were a tad too long for flats but would be fine with a platformwedgeheel comfortable fit in the thighs and overall flattering shape however the waisthip area was too big and the pockets werent centered on my butt so that looked a bit off im thinking of returning these and ordering a smaller size but im not sure which size to get because the size chart was not accurate for me,1

"I mainly bought these shorts for hiking.  However, after buying them I feel like they can be worn whenever (excercising, walking, lounging, etc.).  They are very comfortable and water resistant.  The zip pockets are super nice as well.  I was really happy with the first pair so I bought several more!  I would definitely recommend them.The only things I was disappointed with were the reflective strips have worn a little bit and the zipper handle broke off on one of the pockets.  Just minor things though and still very happy with them.",i mainly bought these shorts for hiking  however after buying them i feel like they can be worn whenever excercising walking lounging etc  they are very comfortable and water resistant  the zip pockets are super nice as well  i was really happy with the first pair so i bought several more  i would definitely recommend themthe only things i was disappointed with were the reflective strips have worn a little bit and the zipper handle broke off on one of the pockets  just minor things though and still very happy with them,1
